    "synopsis": "Akane Takanashi and her younger sister Hiyori are unexpectedly teleported to an unfamiliar world along with their house and everything inside it. Cain, the kingdom's second prince, tells the two girls that they have been summoned to fight against the miasma that appears every several hundred years. To make matters more confusing, they are told that Hiyori is the priestess with the power to purify the miasma.\n\nWhile studying as the priestess, Hiyori is stressed by the food served at the palace and asks Akane to cook her homemade meals again. Happy to be able to help her sister, Akane begins cooking various dishes every day, each with their own ingredients, recipe, and flavor. The cozy atmosphere of the sisters' house ends up attracting different types of people, all of whom come to eat meals at the dinner table or enjoy snacks and drinks on the porch. As Akane grows familiar with these faces and the world around her, new friendships begin to blossom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
