    "synopsis": "Due to a traumatic experience, I have a distrust of people called \"sensei.\" I, Makoto Saiki, was called by after school by the most popular and beautiful teacher at my school, Maka Fujiki-sensei. \"I... love you.\" Eh— a confession out of the blue!? \"Until you say you love me, I will continue to pursue you.\"\n\nEver since then, I've been called by for \"guidance counseling\" after school, somehow watched AV together, being given excessive skin-ship, went on dates together. Over time, I gradually became conscious of Sensei...? But isn't it bad for Sensei to go out with her student? A romance that is absolutely NG, the forbidden love between us two. Lesson start!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
