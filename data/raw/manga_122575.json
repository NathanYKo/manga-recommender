    "synopsis": "To pursue her dream of becoming an author, young Hanako abandons her home in Japan to journey to England. However, belittled and rejected by the publishing company of her favorite writer, she finds herself with nowhere to turn to—until she meets Alice Douglas, a noblewoman kind enough to take her in as a maid.\n\nHanako enjoys working as Alice's personal maid, and despite being in different social classes, the two gradually become close. One day, Alice offers to grant Hanako's deepest wish, but only under one condition—Hanako must kill her in return. Attempting to understand why she would so eagerly seek her death, Hanako learns that there is more to the noblewoman than meets the eye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
