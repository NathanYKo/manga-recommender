    "synopsis": "In Ouji Doumoto's eyes, Himeno Aikawa is difficult to understand. Strict and intimidating, she always lectures the boys for running in the hallways and bringing manga to school. Hence, when she asks him to meet her at the back of their class, the idea of Himeno liking him perplexes Ouji. Since Himeno struggles to convey her feelings, an interesting relationship develops between the two as they misunderstand each other's perception of themselves. Ouji finds Himeno scary and tries his best to avoid angering her, but she believes that he is already her boyfriend, albeit frustratingly dense at times.\n\nIrritated with Ouji's cluelessness, Himeno tries to capture his attention with what she likes to do the most—attempting to impress people by impersonating an adult way beyond her age. Hilarity ensues as the two elementary school students continue their peculiar relationship, all while being oblivious to what the other party truly feels.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
