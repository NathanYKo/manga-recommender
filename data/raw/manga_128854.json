    "synopsis": "Among their high school peers, Seki and Iwashiro are both outliers—yet share no similarities. Sporting dyed blonde unkempt hair and multiple ear piercings, Seki is the school board's natural enemy. One day, while he is skipping class with his friends, he drops a lewd magazine in a collision with the straight-laced Iwashiro. The living embodiment of a model student, Iwashiro immediately disposes of the magazine, only furthering his image as a cold and unreadable \"alien,\" as his classmates call him behind his back.\n\nDespite Seki's wishes to steer clear of the strange boy, they continue to cross paths—which leads to Seki accidentally pushing Iwashiro down the staircase. Despite spraining his ankle in the fall, Iwashiro decides to let Seki go without reporting him under one condition: he must come to Iwashiro's aid whenever he needs help carrying anything.\n\nAlthough initially annoyed by his newfound responsibility, Seki comes to Iwashiro's side without fail each time. As the two develop a mutual understanding and appreciation of what makes them so different, a budding relationship forms between the two outsiders.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
