    "synopsis": "The title of king implies grandeur or, at the very least, delusions of it. For Jing, the King of Bandits, all he has to his name are fear-mongering rumors that have spread between the cracks of civilization. Despite his infamy, he, along with his partner in crime and incurable womanizer Kir, roams the recesses of the world. Those who witness the pair with anxious hearts and minds cower at the thought of becoming Jing's next target.\n\nBut with every grand heist, it is not just mere precious treasures Jing is seeking to pry from his unwitting victims. Their undivided attention is just as valuable, showing how they ruin themselves over their foolishly prized possessions. Jing knows there is no better way to make his demands than through awe-inspiring fear—fear of the King of Bandits.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
