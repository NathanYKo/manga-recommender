Aseph's life, however, has been filled with misery.\n\nUnable to finish reading the novel titled Sentence of God, Han Jae can't help but feel pity for Aseph. After crying over his fate and dreaming of him for over a year, she finally makes her mind up to finish the novel. However, Aseph's death at the end brings her great sorrow. Unable to bear the tragedy, she cries herself to sleep only to wake up as Elzay Tiathe, twin sister of Elissa—the novel's heroine—who does not exist in the story. Knowing all the miseries that await Aseph in the future, will she be able to change his destiny?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
