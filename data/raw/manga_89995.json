    "synopsis": "In a world full of cephalopod hybrids, there is a beloved game known as the Turf Battle in which two teams of four compete against each other to cover up the most space in an arena with their ink. As Haikara City begins the coveted CoroCoro Cup, four squid friends team up despite their middling ranks: the carefree Goggles-kun with his Splashooter Collab, the level-headed Headphones-chan with her Squicklean alpha, the ever-jubilant Knit Cap-chan with her Bucket Slosher, and stern Megane-kun with his Hokusai.\n\nAs expected of a competitive tournament, the four squids representing Team Blue come across many skilled adversaries on the other teams, such as their first opponent, the S+ ranked Roller user Rider. Despite this, Team Blue strives to work against the odds and make their mark on their tournamentsâ€”and perhaps on their rivals as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
