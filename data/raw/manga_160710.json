    "synopsis": "Long before Naruto Uzumaki mastered the formidable Rasengan, Minato Namikaze trains to develop the ninjutsu under the tutelage of his mentor Jiraiya. Minato strives to create his own powerful technique to protect Kushina Uzumaki, the strong-willed woman he loves.\n\nHonoring Uzumaki clan tradition, Kushina's body hosts the nine-tailed fox spirit, Kurama. The demon seeks to break free from his confines and wreak havoc on the world. As Kushina struggles against Kurama's power and her own inner turmoil, Minato hurries to complete the Rasengan and save her from herself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
