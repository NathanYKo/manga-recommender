    "synopsis": "Together with the new friends she met at a school camp, Koharu Hanamura is excited to finally begin her high school experience. But when reuniting with Nanaya Asuka and Minori Kazami, Koharu is startled by a beautiful girl that passes them by. Soon after, she discovers that the girl, Mafuyu Shirotsuki, lives far away in the city and is rumored to be extremely shy. Despite this, when Koharu is separated from her friends in a crowd, she gets the chance to talk to Mafuyu.\n\nKoharu recognizes Mafuyu as a classmate from early childhood and invites her to view cherry blossoms after school. However, it becomes apparent that Koharu has not changed much over the years, causing sensitive feelings to resurface within Mafuyu. Once the two girls begin seeing each other regularly, their relationship blossoms, marking the start of their wonderful days together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
