    "synopsis": "The protagonist, Yuuji Inaka, was ran over by a truck because his awareness was dulled from overworking. \"Ah, with this I don't have to work so much anymore. I want to spend my next life leisurely...\" was the wish Yuuji blurted out. He met God and it was decided he will be reincarnated in the countryside in another world. He then became Alfred Slowlet, the 2nd son of a countryside noble. Now, will he really be able to enjoy and leisurely spend his slow life in the countryside as he wished?\n\n(Source: Takarajimasha, translated)",
