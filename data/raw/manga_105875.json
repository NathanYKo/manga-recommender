    "synopsis": "On the morning of June 7, Makaji Sahara dies at a busy street crossing after stepping right into the path of an oncoming truck. His classmates grieve his passing, but they are unaware that he is still among them as a ghost. Accompanying him is the spirit of a young girl who died at the same intersection 10 years ago.\n\nSahara cannot help but be fascinated by the reactions of his classmates. Although brash and tomboyish, Renjou is the one who cries the most; Chiaki Aikawa, Sahara's childhood friend, who was standing beside him when he died, is expressionless and impassive; and Taku Saitou, who experienced Sahara's frequent teasing, just prays that Sahara's spirit does not curse him.\n\nThere are just a few words Sahara wants to leave behind—his death was no mere accident, and he will make sure that no one but he and the young girl fall victim to the culprit.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
