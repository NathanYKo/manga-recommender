    "synopsis": "After seeing her family slaughtered, Aiko is surprised to wake up on a laboratory table, apparently intact. But when she notices the horribly disfigured arm grafted onto her body, she soon realizes that life as she knew it before the attack is now over. Infused with the DNA of a mysterious monster known as Chimera, the arm acts on the urges of its master—leaving Aiko powerless to stop it. Alone and frightened, how will she deal with this horrible fate?\n\n(Source: CMX)",
