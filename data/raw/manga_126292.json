    "synopsis": "With firm determination, Asahi Oniwa steps out of his comfort zone on his first day of high school. He decides to abandon his hesitant personality and construct an outgoing and friendly image for himself. Following a spectacular narrative performance by the Theater Club's president at freshman orientation, Asahi promptly joins the club and becomes their newest and fourth member.\n\nThe modest club's vice president, Botan Yurigasaki, introduces the other members: prop and costume designer Kaoru Kinugawa and president Imari Kikuji—who, despite his apprehensive and asocial nature, has outstanding acting skills and confidence playing a role. Inspired by Imari's exhibition, Asahi eagerly studies the delicate art of theater. Starting with simple vocalization exercises, Asahi has one month to overcome his fears and prepare to take the stage for the first time ever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
