    "synopsis": "Scoring a job at Square Enix, Sasaki Shougo's dream of producing a Final Fantasy game finally seems within his grasp! But after he starts, he quickly discovers that the work has nothing to do with his favorite franchise at allâ€¦ Disillusioned, his enthusiasm for FF begins waning despite his sister/co-worker Yuuko's attempts to lift his spirits. Their conversation is cut short, though, when a runaway truck suddenly careens toward the two of them!\n\nWhen Shougo comes to, the first thing he sees is... a Moogle?! Wait, was that a Cure spell? And chocobos?! Hurled into a Final Fantasy world unbound to any particular installment, how will an uber-fan like Shougo survive?!\n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
