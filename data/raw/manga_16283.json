Everything about him is normal except one thing: ghosts are attracted to him.\n\nOne day, someone saved him from all the ghosts he had attracted. His so-called hero introduced himself as Undertaker Riddle who sends spirits to peace. Sakura then asked him a favor if he could help him get rid of the ghosts, and in exchange he'll do anything. Undertaker Riddle then offered Sakura to work for him as an Undertaker too. Will he take the job and get rid of the ghosts, or decline the job and have the ghosts in his tail for the rest of his life??\n\n(Source: Manga Zone Scans)",
