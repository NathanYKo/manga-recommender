He will do what he believes is best to attain his customers' satisfaction. \n\nAmong his \"special\" customers are the likes of Tatsuyuki Ooyamoto, the heir to a yakuza syndicate who has been causing some problems for Oasis regular Asoda, and even famous actor Yuu Umehara, who frequents the clinic. \n\nDespite his success, no matter how many customers he satisfies, he will never forget his failures as a doctor nor the man from his past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
