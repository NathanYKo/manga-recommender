    "synopsis": "At a business meeting, 26-year-old Tsugumi Kawana faces the biggest surprise in her life: she is reunited with Itsuki Ayukawa, a former high school friend and her first love. She is elated that Ayukawa has been able to achieve his dream of becoming an architect, while she herself has secured a stable job at an interior design company. As they reminisce about the past, Tsugumi is shocked to find out Ayukawa has been disabled following an accident. Unable to walk on his own, he now has to rely on the use of a wheelchair.\n\nTsugumi knows that dating a disabled person is a complex matter; moreso, she does not want to ruin her friendship with Ayukawa, who refuses to be romantically involved with anyone. However, as she begins to interact with him more and learns about his condition, Tsugumi realizes her feelings for him may not have disappeared entirely.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
