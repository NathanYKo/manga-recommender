    "synopsis": "Asuka Masamune is a boy who loves all things cute, fluffy, sparkling, and sweet, much to his mother's dismay and horror. Due to an incident surrounding his father leaving the family, Asuka was pressured into abandoning his hobbies in favor of kendo, judo, and karate. Resigning himself into living his life as someone who exudes manliness, he becomes the nationally ranked captain of his school's kendo team. Unfortunately, Asuka finds himself falling back on his old interests after crossing paths and falling in love with transfer student Ryo Miyakozuka.\n\nRyo is the exact opposite of Asuka. She has no interest in cooking, sewing, nor anything else that is \"girly\" in nature; however, she has a fierce kick and an equally tough attitude to match. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to collect material for a shoujo manga he is secretly publishing, Asuka's friend, Juta Tachibana, convinces Asuka to befriend the girl. As the relationship between the two begins to blossom, so does Asuka's true nature as an \"otomen.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 10: Glass no Otomen: Sen no Kamen wo Motsu Otomen\nVolume 11: Love-Tic",
