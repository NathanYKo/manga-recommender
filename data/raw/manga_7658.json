    "synopsis": "Innocent 16-year-old Honey Kisaragi has just transferred to a Catholic school for girls, where she is enamored by everyone around her—including the teachers and her new best friend, Natsuko Aki. Later that night, Honey hears her father, the famous scientist Dr. Kisaragi, calling for help, and on her way over, she discovers that she can magically transform her clothes into various costumes.\n\nBut at home, Honey finds her father dying in the arms of a reporter named Seiji Hayami, who had been interviewing him earlier. From her father's robot, Honey learns that she is, in fact, not human; she is a special android called \"Cutie Honey,\" built with an innovative piece of technology which allows her to shapeshift into seven different forms.\n\nAs the technology inside Honey can convert airborne particles into any and all types of matter, Dr. Kisaragi has been targeted by the organization called Panther Claw—a group of underground female cyborgs who greedily wish to use this technology for their own agenda. Now, Honey must protect her secret identity and avenge her late father by confronting any obstacle that Panther Claw sends her way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
