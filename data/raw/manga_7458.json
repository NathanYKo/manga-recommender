    "synopsis": "A serial killer terrorizes the streets of Los Angeles. This brilliant psychopath commits seemingly perfect murders, brazenly challenging the police with cryptic riddles. The enigmatic and world-famous detective L has been hired to crack the case. However, to keep himself out of the public eye, L seeks out FBI agent Naomi Misora to carry out the investigation for him.\n\nMisora agrees to aid L's endeavors, but soon finds herself caught up in an intense battle of wits between L and the culprit. Who is this mysterious killer, and why do they leave clues for the LAPD to decipher? Death Note Another Note: Los Angeles BB Renzoku Satsujin Jiken follows Misora on her journey to solve these mysteries and bring the indiscriminate murders to an end once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
