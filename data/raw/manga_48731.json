    "synopsis": "Yui Komori's priest father leaves her behind in Japan when he accepts a new assignment in Eastern Europe. Entering the foreboding mansion belonging to distant relatives she has never known, she steps into evident darkness. In what little light there is, she notices a figure sleeping on a couch and approaches him, making several observations in quick succession: he is remarkably good-looking as well as cold to the touch, not to mention he is not breathing. She is prevented from calling an ambulance by a sudden aberration in her heartbeat, and in that moment of hesitation, the person whom she presumed to be dead sits up and speaks!\n\nThe handsome stranger complains that she woke him and asks for a treat in compensation, flashing fangs in his mouth. Desperate for rescue, Yui screams and attracts the other occupants of the house. Each new arrival looks as striking as the last, but they all appear to be vampires as well. The Sakamaki brothers—Shuu, Reiji, Ayato, Kanato, Laito, and Subaru—seem set upon making a communal meal out of her, unconcerned that she will die on her first day in their home. She struggles against their hold, and finally protests that it should be her choice as to who gets to suck her blood. This makes the brothers pause, but now she has to follow through on her words. Regardless of who she pledges herself to, can she expect anything but the worst treatment from a predator hungering for their prey?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
