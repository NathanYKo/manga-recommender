    "synopsis": "22-year-old Eikichi Onizuka: pervert, former gang member... and teacher?\n\nGreat Teacher Onizuka follows the incredible, though often ridiculous, antics of the titular teacher as he attempts to outwit and win over the cunning Class 3-4 that is determined to have him removed from the school. However, other obstacles present themselves throughout—including the frustrated, balding vice principal, Hiroshi Uchiyamada; old enemies from his biker days; and his own idiotic teaching methods. But Eikichi fights it all whilst trying to help his students, romance fellow teacher Azusa Fuyutsuki, and earn his self-proclaimed title.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nAlso contains the gaiden \"GTO: Great Toroko Oppai♡\" (Tomoko's Big Adventures).",
