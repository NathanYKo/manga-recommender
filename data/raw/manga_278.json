It is later discovered that he is a legendary swordsman who was placed in a magical realm called the Moorim where the fiercest warriors stayed.\n\nWhen a disaster occurred in hell where the most wicked demons escaped into the world of Mortals, the King of Hell sends Majeh out to capture these escape demons...\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
