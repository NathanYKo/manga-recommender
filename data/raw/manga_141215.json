    "synopsis": "Kiyoko Itou and Mitsu Sonoda have always found happiness in each other's company. Through a fateful encounter many years ago, their worries about the future transformed into a dream to be together, yet love between two women was deemed taboo at the time. Tormented by the heavy expectations of others, Kiyoko could never commit to the relationship. Even so, Kiyoko and Mitsu promise not to abandon one another and wait for the right opportunity to reunite. Only time will tell the extent to which their bond can endure life's endless trials.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
