    "synopsis": "Hiroto, a part-timer without a steady job, is on his lunch break in the park when a cute little boy appears in front of him and stares enviously at Hiroto's lunch. The child looks so irresistibly cute and hungry, Hiroto shares his lunch with the boy. When the child's father, Suguru, finally shows up and sees his picky-eater son enjoying a meal, he offers Hiroto a housekeeping job! The father is a pilot and cannot be home all the time, and needs a caretaker for the boy and their beautiful home. Just as things start going well for Hiroto, he begins to fall for Suguru...and learns that the previous housekeeper had to resign because of romantic involvement with the dashing pilot! Can Hiroto keep his emotions in check?\n\n(Source: Juné)\n\nIncluded one-shots: Sonna Kimi ga Suki, Konna Boku demo Suki?, Moshi Makawari no Koi demo, Sausage Suki Desho?",
