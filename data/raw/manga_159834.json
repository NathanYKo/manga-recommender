    "synopsis": "In the year 2020, humanity faces a crisis as Earth is attacked by unidentified monsters. Players prepare for the attack by challenging the Labyrinth that appeared. They can choose four options: Easy Mode, where anyone can survive; Normal Mode, where you must work to survive; Hard Mode, where only 1% could survive; and Solo Mode, the harshest difficulty.\n\nTaesan Kang, the strongest Easy Mode player, cleared the Labyrinth using an unconventional approach and acquired skills others could not: [Addition, Multiplication, Attack Nullification, Ultimate Judgement...]. But because he chose Easy Mode, his power was lacking. Unable to prevent the extinction of humanity, he lay dying. A miraculous chance appears.\n\n\"This time I'll definitely become stronger.\"\n\nChallenging the Labyrinth again, this is Skill-based Player Taesan Kang's Solo Mode Attack Record!\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",
