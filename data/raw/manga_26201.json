He's not sure why he's there, as he only exchanged a few words with Hikaru at school.\n\nHowever, Hikaru doesn't seem to be completely gone from the world, as he comes back as a ghost in order to fulfill a promise to Aoi Saotome, his fiancée. Since Koremitsu is the only one who can see him, he asks him to carry out his promise in his place.\n\nComplying with his request, Koremitsu tries to fulfill Hikaru's promises to the rest of his \"girlfriends,\" helping them overcome past misunderstandings and repair broken relationships. But the situation surrounding Hikaru's death is shrouded in mystery, as it's uncertain whether or not he truly died in an accident...",
