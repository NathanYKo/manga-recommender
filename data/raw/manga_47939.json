    "synopsis": "Tatsuo is a makeup artist for a fashion photographer and is sick and tired of the models fawning over the new hairstylist, Haga. One morning, he comes across one of the models running out of Haga's room with tears in her eyes and has a long talk with him about how rude and antisocial he is. That's when Tatsuo realizes, Haga doesn't really know how to treat others and doesn't even have a single friend—until now?\n\n(Source: Spicy Scanlations)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Onizuka-sensei no Okiniiri\n\nAlso includes the spin-off \"Moshi Koi da Toshite\" (If This is Love, Goodbye My Dear Friend).",
