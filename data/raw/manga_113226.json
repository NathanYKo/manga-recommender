    "synopsis": "Professor Noah Minami Umberbach is not your average archeologist! For one, he's prone to whipping out his gun and blowing up stuff to make dramatic entrances. But that's just his eccentric nature and he's a man on a mission. A mission that may very well be the most important mission of all time. And he's dragging unlucky student, Kotobuki, along for the ride!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Kamidori",
