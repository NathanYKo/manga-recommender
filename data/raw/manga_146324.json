    "synopsis": "Minami and Yuzu have been inseparable since elementary school. But now that they're in high school, Minami just can't accept that Yuzu may someday get a boyfriend. How come some random guy gets to wake her up in the morning, feed her lunch, take baths with her...? It doesn't take long for Minami to realize that her feelings can't quite be described as \"friendship\" anymore, but how can she get Yuzu to see her the same way?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
