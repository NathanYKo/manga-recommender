    "synopsis": "Yaotomi Eiju has seemingly been the luckiest and most successful young businessman in Japan—that is, until he finds an unusual envelope in his mailbox. Since opening that letter, everything has suddenly gone downhill. From bumping into strangers in public to making simple mistakes on the job, hardships follow him everywhere.\n\nOne evening, Yaotomi comes across a Jizo statue and briefly prays for his luck to return. But instead of getting his wish granted, Yaotomi starts seeing strange spirits and deities, including the perpetrator behind all his newfound problems: the god of disaster, Yato. He learns that Yato must bring adversity into his life because his unnatural luck is upsetting the universe and throwing it off balance. Desperate, Yaotomi visits countless shrines, exorcists, and shamans, but the supernatural entity refuses to leave his side. In the midst of such misfortune, however, a glimmer of hope may lie in Yato himself, as he continues to surprise Yaotomi the more the two stay by each other's side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
