    "synopsis": "After death, another gate opens for victims of unspeakable crimes, terrible accidents, and hellish lives. The Gate of Grudges is guarded by a lady named Izuko, who offers those that enter three options: to accept their death and ascend to Heaven, to remain on Earth as a ghost, or to haunt and kill someone. While the last option is appealing to most, the moral implications of their actions will cost them an eternity of damnation in Hell. As each victim has 12 days to weigh their options, Izuko is there to guide them to a decision they will not regret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
