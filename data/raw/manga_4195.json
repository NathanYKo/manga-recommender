The quiet but easily angered Wakana is usually seen texting during class to Mizuno, a boy from another school. when her phone is taken away. After waiting until class had ended for her phone,  Touto approaches her with her phone and suddenly makes a love confession.\n\nEven though Wakana doubts the seriousness of Touto-sensei's confession, it is confirmed the next day after class when he awaits her answer of going out or not. Through a series of arguments, Wakana approaches Mizuno only to be rejected when he introduces his new girlfriend, and Wakana runs into the arms of Touto-sensei.\n\nThey then decide on a ‘trial date’ so that they can move slowly and see if Wakana is willing to stay as Touto's girlfriend.",
