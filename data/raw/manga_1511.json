    "synopsis": "In their first year of middle school, Akatsuki Higashino and Kiyoharu Kido were the only members of their basketball club. However, they find themselves transferred to the nearby Takadori Ichuu Middle School the next year and decide to join its basketball club, wishing to continue playing together.\n\nTo Akatsuki's surprise, Takadori Ichuu has a very strong team, and entering it is more difficult than he thinks. Although he has exceptional dribbling skills, Akatsuki is terrible at shooting the ball and scoring points. As a result, he is placed in Team F—a place for those who fail the selection—while Kiyoharu manages to enter the reserves.\n\nDespite the outcome of the tryout, the optimistic Akatsuki is not discouraged in his quest to join Kiyoharu. Thus, the two friends promise each other to never give up on their beloved sport, striving to once again stand on the same court together as starting players of the Takadori Ichuu Middle School basketball team.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
