    "synopsis": "Hosato Tobari has always loved cute things. However, as he grew older, he became conscious that he should not voice his preferences aloud. For this reason, when he discovers cross-dressing as a means to make himself look cute, he immediately treats the activity as another shameful secret to hide away.\n\nOn a day when Tobari is out shopping while wearing a schoolgirl uniform and a wig, he is alarmed to catch the attention of someone he recognizes. Unfortunately, his classmate—Morio Inui—reveals that he photographed Tobari in his feminine attire. Inui begins by questioning why Tobari dresses in drag, but the situation further escalates when he threatens to use the picture as blackmail material. In exchange for his silence, Inui insists that Tobari spend time with him in the clothes he truly loves. As much as Tobari comes to enjoy their escapades, he cannot help but fear the inevitable consequences of the risks he is taking with Inui.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
