One day, Sokabe stumbles on Motoi's very large collection of BL manga that immediately catches his attention and in a panic he ends up being mistaken by Motoi, who is a hardcore fudanshi, as a fellow BL enthusiast. Now Sokabe must find a way to either confess his feelings or forever keep his silence as Motoi drags him into the world of sexy semes and blushing ukes.",
