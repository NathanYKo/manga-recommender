    "synopsis": "Indiscriminately and without warning, numerous people around the world receive foreboding news. Contained in a harrowing three-part message are: the name of the recipient, the fact they are doomed to Hell, and the exact amount of time they have left on Earth. There is no use running, and no one will answer their pleas for salvation. For these people, their fate is certain—a public demonstration in which primordial beings will brutalize the victim and leave behind nothing but a hollowed-out husk.\n\nAccording to an emerging religious organization, these are acts of God, who is condemning sinners to where they belong. The leader of the religious group is a young man named Jeong Jinsu, who entreats the populace to live righteously and without evil to avoid such a fate. Dubious of these supernatural claims, the police in Seoul assign the detective Jin Gyeonghun to investigate the recent death of a man, which is being attributed to this phenomenon. As he grapples with his own grievances over the release of his wife's murderer, Detective Jin begins to unravel the truth behind the organization's leader and the phenomena of those bound for Hell.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
