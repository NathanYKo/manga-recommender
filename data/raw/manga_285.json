    "synopsis": "Tomonori Ozawa has just landed a job at a large publishing firm. The only catch is, he is the new editor of a Boy’s Love magazine?! On top of that, he is stuck with dealing with the artist Sakurako Kakyoin, a male yaoi artist who is notorious for missing his deadlines. To become a full fledged editor, Tomonori-kun has to start from the bottom – checking drafts, editing scripts and lettering. Now if only Kakyoin-sensei would stop sexually harassing him, he could actually get some work done! \n\n(Source: DMP)",
