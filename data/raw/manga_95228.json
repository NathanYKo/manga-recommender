    "synopsis": "At only the age of 15, Shuugo \"Sougorou Matsukawa\" Azuma, heir of the Tamano family—a renowned lineage in the world of kabuki—is considered talented among his peers regarding his skills in the art. Because of his boosted ego, Sougorou is uninterested in any other actor his age. However, his attitude changes when he watches a performance from the Ootani family's successor, Junpei \"Gensuke Arai'' Noda. After being blown away by Gensuke's acting, Sougorou decides to further polish his skills, swearing to surpass Gensuke one day.\n\nTwo years later, Sougorou encounters his rival at his school and finds out that not only are they classmates, but Gensuke has also been keeping tabs on him. In order to outperform Gensuke, Sougorou puts everything into his biggest role yet, only to receive a lukewarm response from the audience.\n\nWhile at a loss for what to do to prove he is better than Gensuke, Sougorou finds his prayers answered. However, to his dismay, he must partner up with Gensuke to play a married couple for his next performance. Despite his reluctance, Sougorou accepts this opportunity, hoping that it might propel him into the spotlight. Although Sougorou has to force himself to work with Gensuke, their time together might unwittingly improve both his acting and his relationship with his rival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
