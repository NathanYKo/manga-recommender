    "synopsis": "Amidst a post-apocalyptic world, Chito and Yuuri seem to be the final survivors of the war that brought civilization to its demise. No longer having a place to live, the girls roam around the city on their half-track motorcycle, ever in search of resources to sustain their vagabond lifestyle. Despite the bleak future ahead of them, the duo still finds ways to entertain themselves throughout this melancholic journey. \n\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou takes place in a barren world during the harsh winter season. As the happy-go-lucky Yuuri and the serious Chito hopelessly search for a sign of civilization, their expedition may in fact become humanity's last tour.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
