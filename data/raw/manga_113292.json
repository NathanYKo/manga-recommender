    "synopsis": "Beings that create and control monsters and demons, beings that build and reign over malicious labyrinths, the chosen individuals to possess an overwhelming Unique Skill—they are the Demon Lords.\n\nDemon Lords entice people to come to the labyrinth they've built and eat the people's despair as their nourishment. However, newly born Demon Lord Procell has decided that he will obtain people's hopes and not their despair as nourishment, and build a happy town instead of a malicious labyrinth to collect human beings.\n\nThis is the story of an eccentric Demon Lord, with all its ins and outs.\n\n(Source: Novel Updates, edited)",
