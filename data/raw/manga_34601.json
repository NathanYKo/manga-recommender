    "synopsis": "Dream Fossil is a collection of 15 short manga stories by the late Satoshi Kon. These short stories, serialized in a variety of magazines and collections in the 1980s, give a rare glimpse into the early stages of Kon's uniquely compelling style of storytelling. The buds of dream-like themes and imaginative worldviews that would blossom in his later animated works are also readily apparent. Yet the flights of fancy are anchored by knowing, empathetic portrayals of the very human characters at the center of each story.\n\n1. Carve\n2. Horseplay\n3. Baseball Brats\n4.
