His breakfast always consists of onigiri and instant miso soup from the convenience store.\n\nYae, a childhood friend of Zenichirou, cannot stand to see him eat such an innutritious breakfast, so she decides to make him breakfast every morning...\n\nThis story conveys a simple message: eating with another person makes miso soup taste more delicious and hearty!\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Seishun Re:verse",
