    "synopsis": "An uprising in the kingdom of Earlswald has led to the death of its lecherous and tyrannical king, his wife, and their son. Cayden, the leader of the rebellion, is crowned as the new monarch and grants his right-hand man, Eli—a peasant—the title of duke. Although considered a hero thanks to his achievements during the war, Eli is rumored to be a cold-blooded madman who strikes fear in his allies and enemies alike.\n\nDue to supporting the former king in the past, a nobleman must marry off his eldest daughter to Eli. But he instead sends a servant named Edna under the pretext that she is his illegitimate child.\n\nDespite their rocky start as newlyweds, Eli is intrigued by Edna's sophisticated demeanor and fiery personality, while she finds her husband to be more than what the rumors make him out to be. Nonetheless, Edna must maintain her facade because if Eli were to discover who she truly is and why she cares so much for the kingdom, it would cost her not only their marriage—but also her life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: This entry includes the sequel series Golden Time as they are serialized on the same page on Kakao.",
