Although they look like ordinary junior high school students, when they unite, these twins produce Miracle Powers. Telepathy, teleportation, and magic are all used to help the girls get through the day. Nobody knew about Toni and Mika's powers until a nosey classmate discovered their secret. Can the twins keep their powers a secret or will they be exposed to the world?\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Sukoshi dake Mystery",
