    "background": "Ai no Kusabi was collected in a single hardbound novel in 1990. It was then revised and expanded by Seibidou Shuppan under the Crystal imprint. Crystal's release was incomplete, discontinuing at the sixth volume as opposed to the planned eight volumes. Tokuma Shoten acquired the series and released it under the Chara imprint; their release was composed of six volumes with the first four volumes corresponding to Crystal's volumes 1-6. Chara's last two volumes are the remaining unpublished material. The series was published in English by Digital Manga Publishing from November 19, 2003 to November 28, 2013 with 8 volumes. Volumes 1-6 correspond to Crystal edition's, and the last two volumes to Chara edition's volumes 5 and 6.",
