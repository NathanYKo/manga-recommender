    "synopsis": "Kotaki Yumeji was just your typical high school student—until his childhood friend, Chieri Oomine, transferred into his class, now standing at a jaw-dropping eight meters tall! As Chieri's assigned helper, Yumeji finds himself navigating the ups and downs of school life in more ways than one. From giant-sized mishaps to tender moments, their unique relationship is full of heart-pounding surprises. But even with a height difference this extreme, who's to say that romance is out of reach? Get ready for a romantic comedy that's truly larger than life!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
