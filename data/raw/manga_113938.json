    "synopsis": "Ikuma and Sumika Saeki are two childhood friends who have recently married. However, despite being deeply in love with each other, they have yet to cross a hurdle that lies in their happy and youthful life—to have sex.\n\nDue to the duo's inexperience, the two virgins are left awkward and embarrassed when the thought of it enters their mind. They try their best to attempt intercourse, from simply asking their partner to being aggressive and making a move, but it tends to end in the most anticlimactic of ways. Thus, the awkward yet hilarious story of them trying to kickstart their nightly activities begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
