    "synopsis": "The mischievous Jian Yi and the level-headed Zhan Zhengxi have been best friends since early childhood. Now, as they are entangled in the follies of high school, their bond has deepened. Jian Yi all but hides his romantic feelings for Zhan Zhengxi, who, despite pretending to dislike Jian Yi's teasing, cannot keep his true emotions from occasionally slipping through.\n\nAmid various festivals, classroom antics, and frequent shenanigans, Jian Yi and Zhan Zhengxi are soon joined by the rebellious delinquent Mo Guanshan and the handsome flirt He Tian. Together, they embrace the vibrant days of youth—always with a hint of romance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
