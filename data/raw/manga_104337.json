    "synopsis": "Honda is a skeleton, but more importantly, she is a bookseller. And she'll tell you from firsthand experience that the job of a bookstore employee is more challenging than it may seem to the average customer.\n\nAlongside her equally eccentric coworkers, Honda constantly deals with the stressful requirements of the bookselling industry. From the drama of receiving new titles without their bonus material to the struggle of providing quality service to customers who speak a different language, the work of a skeleton bookseller never ends.\n\nNevertheless, despite the hardships she faces, Honda thoroughly enjoys her job and strives to bring the best book selections and service to her customers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
