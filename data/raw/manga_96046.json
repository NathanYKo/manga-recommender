    "synopsis": "In the 27 years of his existence, Moriya Hanazono has been treated poorly due to his naturally scary looks. Working in his family's flower shop, he spends each day happily doing what he loves, regardless of what others think of him. Moriya's life begins to change, however, when he finds college student Hiyori Suzuki hiding in the van he was using to deliver flowers for her school's beauty pageant.\n\nProviding the right advice for Hiyori's troubles, Moriya notices the young woman visiting the flower shop frequently. Unbeknownst to him, she sees something in Moriya that no one else does: that he's actually an adorable person.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
