    "synopsis": "Shirokuma Café provides a pleasant atmosphere that is popular among magazines and its local clientele, with one of its charms being that anyone is welcome regardless of species. The owner of this trendy eatery is a pun-loving polar bear named Shirokuma, who enjoys running the place as much as he likes wordplay. His friends—an easygoing panda and a level-headed penguin—are regulars at the establishment. Even though the three have their own daily lives, the trio always have fun together, whether it is an exciting trip to see new sights and people beyond the cafe or a casual conversation at the end of a long day.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "During the production of its anime adaptation, Shirokuma Café went on a hiatus from May to July 2012, with the author citing a lack of communication between her and the anime staff. The series has been published in English as Polar Bear Café by Seven Seas Entertainment since January 24, 2023.",
