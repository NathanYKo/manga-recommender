    "synopsis": "Toranosuke Ibuki and his wife Kaoru née Okouchi have been devotedly in love for what has seemed like their entire lives. Now, twenty years later, Toranosuke is bedridden in a hospital, but still, their love perseveres. Together, the infatuated couple reminisce about days gone by—when he proposed, when they first met, their relationships with those around them, and their blissful married life. \n\nThough Toranosuke has always been a bit hard-headed and Kaoru a bit short-tempered, their immense love is shown in the wrinkles on their aged skin and in the unbridled devotion in their eyes. It is so strong that they know they will love each other with the same devotion... even in their next life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
