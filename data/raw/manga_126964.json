    "synopsis": "I used to have better grades than this fool!\n\n3 years ago...\n\nRuu Kurokiya, a Kuro Gyaru, is on her way to flunking high school. Her childhood friend, Straight-A student Tadao Tadashi volunteers as private tutor to avert her reckless path―but Ruu's more focused on seducing him than learning, and their study sessions soon go wildly astray! When a \"Gyaru's Pride\" clashes with Tadao's \"Take-it-Serious\" attitude, who knows what will happen next!\n\nAn unexpected rom-com so pure you can't help but cheer it on!\n\n(Source: One Peace Books)",
