    "synopsis": "After waking up at his own funeral, Tenma Ootori gets a second chance at life when a god from another world presents him with an enticing offer: if Tenma agrees to be reincarnated in order to save their dying world, the gods will bestow cheat abilities upon him.\n\nTenma accepts, and is reborn in a lush fantasy world filled with demi-humans, magic spells and items, monsters, mysterious forests, and more! As he grows, more of his gods-given powers and abilities—including his unique power to befriend adorable monsters like slimes and baby wolves—are revealed to his adoptive parents, two former master adventurers, and his grandfather, a famous wizard.\n\nBut one fateful day, three mysterious strangers shatter the tranquility of Tenma's village by trying to kidnap him, and that's where Tenma's adventure really begins...\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
