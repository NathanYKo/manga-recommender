    "synopsis": "Attended by children of nobility, the renowned Souseikan Academy has two main courses—the lord and lady class and the butler class, commonly referred to as the L class and B class respectively. Following the death of her parents, Ryou Himura's grandparents, who come from a declining distinguished family, enroll her into the L class.\n\nOn her first day, Himura gets lost on the school grounds and encounters Hakuou Kanzawa, a popular student from the butler class. Unfamiliar with school norms, she introduces herself to Hakuou in an unusual manner, leaving a strong impression on him. Catching his interest, they develop a friendship that evokes the envy of all the other girls.\n\nDespite unknowingly making enemies, Himura is determined to accomplish a certain goal and begins to acquaint herself with the various aspects that go into becoming a lady with the guidance of her new friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
