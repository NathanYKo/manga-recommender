    "synopsis": "Following the death of his beloved wife, high school teacher Kouhei Inuzuka tried to cook a meal for his five-year-old daughter Tsumugi despite his poor cooking abilities. But after one disastrous attempt, they began relying on food from convenience stores instead. While flower-viewing, Kouhei and Tsumugi run into Kotori Iida, one of Kouhei's socially awkward students. Once she spots Tsumugi trying to take a bite out of her lunch, Kotori invites them to her mother's restaurant.\n\nIn an attempt to feed Tsumugi something delicious, Kouhei barges into the restaurant in the middle of the night—only to find Kotori waiting for them and willing to help him in the kitchen. Although Kotori is as helpless as Kouhei when it comes to cooking, the two manage to make a simple dish. It turns out that, due to her mom's job, Kotori has been eating dinner alone for a long time. For the sake of Tsumugi's happiness, Kouhei promises her and Kotori that they will all eat together—thus marking the first of many sweet moments while sharing meals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
