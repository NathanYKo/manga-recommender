    "synopsis": "Makoto Hitsujiya transfers to a new high school and meets a strange classmate named Takehiro Kokudou. Kokudou introduces him to Bugs, a variety of phenomena that produce certain outcomes only if specific sequential actions are performed. The phenomena can range from bird droppings appearing on a sidewalk after pressing a certain combination of vending machine buttons to being able to lift weights beyond one's normal physical limits.\n\nGradually, Hisujiya and Kokudou's friendship grows as they take advantage of the handy—and sometimes outrageous—conditions to activate Bugs that transcend the laws of science and humanity. Following Kokudou's footsteps, Hitsujiya becomes addicted to triggering these anomalies. But when he discovers a bizarre set of conditions required for a ridiculous Bug that can change his future, his curiosity may have serious consequences.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
