    "synopsis": "With their fossils being all that remained, dinosaurs were believed to be extinct due to a meteor striking the Earth long before humanity existed. But in 1946, the secluded Barakan Island was discovered to be home to a few remaining species of these prehistoric beasts. With successful research in genetic manipulation, dinosaurs were brought back to life, bringing about dinomania around the world. However, excitement quickly dwindled following an incident that led to a person's death.\n\nDespite the rise and fall of the public's interest over the years, 24-year-old Suzume Suma has always wished to interact with and take care of dinosaurs—an aspiration that allows her to land her dream job as a dinosaur keeper at Enoshima Dinoland. As a result of the incident, the dinosaur reserve is barely managing to keep regular visitors with its low staffing and funding. In addition, Suzume can hardly keep up with her coworkers Karin Kirishima and Kaidou. Regardless of the challenges, Suzume stays determined to bring dinomania back in full force!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
