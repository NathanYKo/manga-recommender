    "synopsis": "Laranora Ador gets more than she bargained for when she rescues a young boy from being sold off in an infamous auction house. The boy is actually Eskal Van Dyck, the \"Crazy Marquess,\" in disguise! Unaware of his violent and heartless true nature, Laranora takes Eskal under her wing. Determined to raise him with utmost care and respect, Laranora grows deeply attached to Eskal... and in return, the true Eskal begins to fall in love with her. Unfortunately, Eskal is often targeted for his powerful magic and ruthless ways, which leads to a tragic event that separates the two. But Eskal is determined to find her again as his true self. Will Laranora be able to accept who he really is? And more importantly, what will happen when something fishy brewing in the Imperial Palace may involve them both?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
