    "synopsis": "When he woke up, Tetsujirou Souma, a samurai from Kamakura who had survived the Mongolian invasion, had found himself in an unfamiliar place.\n\nHe was told by Hirst, the girl who brought him there, that they are in Valhalla, a place where the souls of dead warriors congregate. In order for him to be revived, Tetsujirou now has no choice but to fight against the \"dead warriors\" from different eras in this mythical place of carnage that he's been thrown into.\n\nThis is the start of a samurai drama where one has to fight and strike down their enemies, even if it kills them!!\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
