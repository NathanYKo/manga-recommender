Yume confesses her wish to become special and Momo grants it: she makes Yume the representative of the earth! From now on her sixteenth birthday until her eighteenth, Yume has to give Momo seven good reasons as to why she the earth shouldn’t be destroyed. The countdown for the destruction of the world has begun and only Momo can stop it. \n\n(Source: Starry Heaven)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Kimi no Sekai no Sukuikata\nVolume 7: 17 O'Clocks",
