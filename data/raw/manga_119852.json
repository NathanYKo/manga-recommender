    "synopsis": "What do Karasuno High School's volleyball rivals get up to when they are not training for a tournament? From scouting out a video game tournament and debunking ghost myths, to arguing over bunk bed assignments and having troubles with girls—nothing is boring about what this colorful cast of characters can get into during their downtime! Though their competitive spirit is fierce, their comedic potential is just as strong.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
