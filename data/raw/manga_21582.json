    "synopsis": "Wergelder: in Germanic law, the money paid by a murderer or his family to the victim's family in atonement. A mysterious deal goes down on a remote island known as a red-light pleasure district. An insane fight between a blonde sniper and an assassin in a Chinese dress brings up questions about who the players are in this deal. A group of misfit yakuza gets caught in the crossfire while trying to get in on the deal, or at least find out what's being dealt. At the center of it all is a woman who has been wronged in the worst imaginable ways. She will have her revenge.\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
