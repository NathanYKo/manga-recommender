    "synopsis": "\"Satou-san is the unattainable flower of the class. She is always cold and curt with classmates, but only I know she's actually very cute when she smiles, even if she's not much of a photographer.\"\n\n\"Oshio-kun is friendly and lively, but only I know he works at his family's cafe after school. He does a great job with the cafe's SNS account, and his mischievous smile makes my heart skip a beat!\"\n\nInnocent and sweet, but sometimes frustrating, this is a 120%-pure fluffy story about two people falling in love for the first time.\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
