A boy named \"Shizu\" was overcome with strange feelings of anxiety the day after his graduation. Were they directed towards becoming an adult? Does he want to remain a child? It was neither of these. Anxiety embraced Shizu. The anxiety would lead him towards the \"truth\" of his world.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, MU)",
