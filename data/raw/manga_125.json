    "synopsis": "Inez is a young orphan girl with a special gift that allows her to communicate with all creatures. A great destiny awaits her, the nature of which she is yet unaware. As our story opens, Inez is traveling with an old wizard named Kaager and a faithful dog named Zode. Her country is about to plunge into its first winter in one hundred years and ominous signs abound concerning the return of a demon-race which threatens the country's fragile peace. Can little Inez—via a magic amulet—bring back her country's ancient dragon protector in time?\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
