    "synopsis": "Following a brutal rejection of his first love confession, 17-year-old Yuuki Shibuki is left in tears at the park, with nothing to do but curse his misfortune. He was told he was too short and feminine—all of which Yuuki is painfully aware of, but he is still inconsolable. That is, until a tall, hooded stranger plays a beautiful melody on their guitar, lifting Yuuki out of his misery.\n\nAlthough moved by the guitarist, Yuuki's feelings linger. When he returns to the park for some peace and quiet, a tall, gorgeous girl sits next to him, asking if he has gotten over his heartbreak. Introducing herself as Chikako Takamine, she reveals that the song he heard was hers—and it was written specifically for him. Surprised yet grateful, Yuuki accepts the friendly gesture, and the newfound friendship between the two marks the beginning of a beautiful relationship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
