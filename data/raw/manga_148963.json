    "synopsis": "Estio is just an ordinary farmer's son, but with an extraordinary ability—he can read the thoughts and memories of humans and animals. For this, he is shunned by the people in his village, finding happiness only in his animal friends. After years of silently enduring the villagers' hostility, Estio runs away the night he turns 19. His journey brings unexpected friendships and encounters, but will such bonds be able to show him there is more to him and his ability than meets the eye?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
