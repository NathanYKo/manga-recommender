    "synopsis": "High school is a time to find oneself, a period of uncertainty and growth. For most, it's a time to experience love for the first time. For six certain high school students, love is a mystery that threatens to bring them together yet tear them apart at the same time.\n\nRealistic yet outwardly playful Eiji Aihara is close friends with the serious Naohiko Bessho, who is in a long-distance relationship with Izumi Shiosaki, Eiji's childhood friend. Eiji's daily activities put him in contact with Mizuho Ikezawa and Taichi Senami, who has a crush on Ikezawa. Meanwhile, Koharu Fujimura is a girl experiencing her first relationship, yet she is unsure whether this is truly love. After an encounter with Naohiko, her eyes begin to open.\n\nInexperienced and innocent, the lives of these six students begin to intertwine as they come to terms with themselves and grow to discover the true meaning of \"love.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
