    "synopsis": "Kim Cheol detests nothing more than attention, yet his oppressive height and a scar under his eye make him stick out like a sore thumb. In contrast, Cheol's new seatmate, Hwang Mi-ae, is incredibly outgoing and the shortest in their class. They look comical next to each other, and to add to their embarrassment, their names are the same as those of a famous but extremely ridiculous dancing duo.\n\nCheol struggles with controlling his temper and avoids others by any means necessary, while all Mi-ae is interested in are comics, her favorite boy band, and going out with her friends. However, he is her new neighbor, and they even knew each other in early childhood. Despite everyone's fear of Cheol, Mi-ae notices his awkwardness and selfless nature and tries to befriend him. He may be difficult to approach for now, but through the busy days of studying for the high school entrance exams, Cheol will soon become Mi-ae's most precious person.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
