    "synopsis": "Due to the increase in college dorm fees, graduate student Kentou Sasaki has no choice but to move out. He quickly finds an apartment with cheap rent, but there is a catch: neither the bath nor the stove work. Confident that his body will be able to handle the cold, Kentou has no problem with moving in immediately. However, luck is not on his side because he almost freezes to death after a heavy day of snowfall.\n\nHe is unexpectedly saved by Soushi Ikematsu—a man with an aloof personality who loves listening to metal and is Kentou's neighbor. Despite his scary appearance, Soushi makes Kentou a meal to warm him up. Thus, a year goes by, with the two neighbors falling into a comfortable routine of sharing their meals together. To Kentou's disappointment, their relationship has not progressed further. However, in fear that it could put an end to their friendship, Kentou does not have the courage to confess to Soushi that he likes men. Will he be able to keep it a secret when he starts to fall in love with Soushi?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
