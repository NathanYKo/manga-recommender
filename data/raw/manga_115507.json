    "synopsis": "Kyoko Byakuya walks alone at the foot of Mount Sengoku, mysteriously drawn to the place. She notices something odd about the area: the volcanic hair bears a gold appearance, uncommon in Japan. Kyoko soon runs into a strange man named Aizawa, who proclaims he has been expecting her.\n\nAizawa takes Kyoko to his village called Kiyokami, bathed in the same bright gold as the volcanic hair. There, she learns that the hair is known as \"Amagami,\" and it gives them the strange ability to sense the minds of fellow villagers. As Kyoko prepares to leave, the residents invite her to their routine stargazing. However, the ceremony is interrupted when thousands of flying objects cover the sky, and the villagers are suddenly struck with a tormenting vision of jet-black hair—eerily contrasting the comforting gold.\n\nIn the morning, it is announced that Mount Sengoku has erupted. The rescue team discovers Kyoko in the debris, now sporting the golden hair coloring of the Amagami. Now, with the unusual phenomenon and the dark visions that the village has seen in deep space, an unknown terror threatens to be unleashed. Kyoko must save the world before the cosmic nightmare wreaks havoc on humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
