    "synopsis": "Already at his wit's end, 29-year-old corporate slave Seiichirou Kondou suddenly witnesses the ground opening up and swallowing a woman. Amid his efforts to save her, the two are transported to another world. He soon learns that the people in this world summoned a saint to save their kingdom from a plague. As compensation for dragging Kondou into the mess, the kingdom assures him that they will provide him with a comfortable life and fulfill any of his desires. To everyone's surprise, Kondou asks for a job.\n\nAfter successfully becoming an accountant at the Royal Palace, Kondou devotes himself to his new post. His accurate and thorough work catches the attention of various high-ranking officials and knights, especially Aresh Indolark, the cold-hearted Knight Captain. As Kondou adjusts to his new exhausting and dangerous environment, he begins to find solace in the company of Aresh, whose icy demeanor may be just a facade.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
