    "synopsis": "Kazumi is the butler for a very spoiled and self-absorbed young lady, Tsubaki. During working hours, he must endure any of her tantrums with a smile, never blaming her for the poor behavior she displays. Outside of work, however, he is free to tell the truth like it is. Kazumi himself is like a different person when off the clock. He appears disheveled, has a mouth as foul as his temper, and makes no show of hiding his numerous vices: smoking, gambling, and loose women, to name a few.\n\nWhen Kazumi runs into Tsubaki without his professional disguise, he expects her to report him to her father for slacking off on the job. But his worries dissolve as Kazumi does not even recognize him, having just been robbed. In the process of lending her a helping hand, Kazumi unintentionally steals Tsubaki's first kiss, as well as her heart. Suddenly acting cute, Tsubaki is determined to meet with her savior again, unaware that the object of her affections is the person she abuses on a daily basis.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Kuroneko Lily\nVolume 3: Tarou-kun wa Yuganderu\nVolume 4: Amai Wana to Nigai Mitsu\nVolume 9: Hakoniwa Fuufu\nVolume 11: Hakoniwa Oyako",
