While Akiha Konno was on his way to his first day of school in Tokyo, some creep just had to touch his butt...Thankfully, the nice college guy saved him, but, uhhh...Akiha really didn't mean to just glomp him like that! Worse, he called the fox ears that appear when he's all worked up \"cute\"! Welp, it's not like he'll ever see him again...\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
