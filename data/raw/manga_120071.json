    "synopsis": "While they had their own reasons for skipping class, Sakura Adachi and Hougetsu Shimamura unexpectedly met on the second floor of the school gymnasium. Their chance encounter quickly paves the way to a spirited friendship—one free of unpleasant formalities and suffocating expectations. Wandering through the whims of life together, the two grow ever closer; but the blossom of unfettered feelings soon muddles the true nature of their relationship.\n\nAs the dull passage of adolescence inches toward its end, Adachi and Shimamura navigate through intricate yet genuine emotions shared by each other, gradually discovering ripples of color that brighten a once uninspired future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
