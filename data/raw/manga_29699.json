    "synopsis": "In the spring of 1998, 15-year-old Kouichi Sakakibara has just moved to the town of Yomiyama, where he is set to attend the local middle school Yomiyama North. However, when a past injury resurfaces, he is placed in hospital, leading him to miss the first week of school. Though he recovers quickly, before leaving he meets Mei Misaki, a strange, eye-patched girl whose cryptic mannerisms spark a subtle interest within the boy.\n\nAt Yomiyama North, Kouichi is placed in Class 3-3. However, beneath the innocent atmosphere, he finds the class' behavior odd: everyone seems to be on edge and watchful of Kouichi's actions. Moreover, Mei is a student in the class, yet both classmates and teachers do not show any regard for her, as if she is simply not there. Though more oddities arise and more questions spring forth, no one is willing to give Kouichi any answers. With little choice but to ease his growing curiosity, Kouichi starts to pursue Mei for help, against both the class' and her own warnings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
