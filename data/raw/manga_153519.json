    "synopsis": "As the author of \"Swordmaster Sade,\" Sungmin Cha had no idea how dangerous his plot-hole-riddled novel could be until he's reborn as Rasen Mayton, a spoiled side character destined to die at 17. As if being stuck in the body of a rude scumbag despised by everyone wasn't enough, Sungmin also discovers that he was reborn at a point before his story began. With almost no knowledge about the current timeline, will Sungmin be able to survive in this unwritten world as House Mayton's youngest?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
