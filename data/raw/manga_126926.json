    "synopsis": "Shizuki Aoi entered high school and thought he found a new, lifelong friend in fellow first-year Kanata Takemiya. However, as a result of their meeting, Aoi dropped out at the age of 16 and left home at the age of 20. Now, he lives alone in a cramped Tokyo apartment that he rarely exits, poorly coping with depression and a broken heart.\n\nMeanwhile, Tsumugi Sakura attends high school in the distant Kanagawa prefecture. She stands out among her peers due to her gloomy nature and vibrant violet hair. While she is overtly bullied by her classmates, only the handsome Subaru Minazuki will intervene on her behalf, but she is far from grateful to him. Little does she know, Minazuki has his own reasons for singling her out.\n\nAoi and Sakura both believe that life will not improve as long as they remain the same. If only they could switch places with someone else! But when the miraculous happens, they fail to appreciate just how little their situations differ from before. Like tea made from the blue mallow flower, which transforms in color but not taste, the two have yet to change in a way that truly matters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
