    "synopsis": "Ex-idol trainee Kiyu has lived his whole life adored by everyone for his good looks. But he dreams of ordinary high school life, so when he puts on glasses to blend in with his peers, he finds that making friends is a lot harder when you don't have your looks to fall back on. Not to mention he's also socially awkward, his new seatmate has a permanent scowl on her face, and his fans have tracked him down at his new school.\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
