    "synopsis": "High school sophomore Akira Kouno has firmly decided to find romance only in video games. Yet, on the way to school, she meets a tall and glamorous girl named Pure Sakurasaka—her new classmate and self-declared future lover.\n\nDespite her immediate popularity within the class, Pure only has eyes for the unpopular and unsociable Akira. In fact, she even claims that she has come from seven years in the future, when the two were about to be married. Given how different Pure is from her, Akira cannot imagine them being anything more than acquaintances. Nevertheless, the two girls soon find that the future has many surprises dispersed all throughout time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
