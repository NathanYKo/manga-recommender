    "synopsis": "Cooking has always been one of Makie Funatsugi's greatest skills. In an attempt to confess his feelings for his crush Sachi Mitsuhara, Makie summons the courage to give her a cookie he made. But this is not even the hardest part of his day, as Makie must constantly pretend that all the horrifying, flesh-eating monsters only he seems to see are not real. While Makie has always been able to see them, the creatures have recently been getting larger and more disturbing.\n\nWhen a monster ends up trapping Makie and Sachi after school, they surprise each other by acknowledging the being's existence and the otherworldly nest it created. Morphing into one of these beings herself, Makie's ever-hungry upperclassman reveals that she is a watari—monsters that are attracted to Makie's appetizing scent—and makes quick work of the monster. With Sachi proudly vowing to protect him against numerous watari craving for his flesh, Makie finds that his days will never be the same.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
