    "synopsis": "Mitsuo Ichikawa was once at the beck and call of his frightening classmate who was also named Mitsuo Ichikawa. Drawn together by the bond of their name, one became like a servant to the other—and this odd relationship managed to survive the many years they were apart. One day at work, Mitsuo receives a chilling call, and the familiar voice of his namesake greets him with a confession of murder. \n\nWhen one Mitsuo kills a woman in a fit of drunken blindness, he calls on the other to help him get rid of the evidence. The pair are reunited as accomplices and once again become unavoidably entangled with each other—but now the stakes are much, much higher. With the past coming back to haunt Mitsuo, the two must navigate a dangerous world of drugs, gangs, and the consequences of what they have done.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
