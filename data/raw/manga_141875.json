    "synopsis": "Hayato is a master of espionage whose latest job is the Familia Shared House, a sham residence meant to lure enemy agents and turn them to his side. But even Hayato could never predict that the very first resident would be his childhood crush, Seraphy—fully grown and with curves that could start an international incident! Now it's spy against spy and libido against libido...with other impossibly attractive undercover ladies eager to join the fun!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
