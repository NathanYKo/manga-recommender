Join Tsugumi Harudori in the \"NOT\" class at Death Weapon Meister Academy, a school dedicated to training transforming weapons like Tsugumi and the meisters who will wield them. Many \"NOT\" (Normally Overcome Target) students aspire to join the elite \"EAT\" (Especially Advantaged Talent) class. But it may take Tsugumi some time to find her confidence—and a partner—at this crazy school!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
