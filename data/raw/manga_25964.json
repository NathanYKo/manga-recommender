    "synopsis": "After a night of blissful freedom, Cinderella reluctantly returns to a life of mundane servitude. Only yesterday, she was the star of the royal ball—dancing with and captivating the prince. The toll of the clock striking 12 marked the end of that fleeting night and made liberation an impossible dream. But unbeknownst to her, she is being sought after by the kingdom. Will this bring about her salvation, or the exact opposite?\n\nIn this twisted take on the classic folk tale, Cinderella quickly learns that everything has a cost, and anything that sounds too good to be true almost certainly is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
