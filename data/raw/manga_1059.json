    "synopsis": "Neji and his fiancé were killed after getting caught up in an unfortunate kidnapping situation. After being cryogenically frozen by the GERA, the ESP research facility, for 40 years, Neji wakes up. It doesn’t take long for the GERA to discover Neji’s extremely powerful and unnatural powers and to make him into one of their mercenaries. However, Neji finds out his fiancé will be used as a guinea pig for the research facility's medical research and desperately tries to escape. In the second part, Neji encounters his nephew, who is also created from GERA and both begin on their journey through the future where human-like robots are used as slaves. (Source: ANN)",
