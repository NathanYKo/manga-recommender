    "synopsis": "In the Gokuraku district—a melting pot of humans, beastmen, and now mermaids—Tao and Alma, a pair of self-proclaimed jack-of-all-trades troubleshooters, are the people to contact when a problem needs fixing. Although motivated by money, food, and Tao's mood, they have a hard time saying no to meek little mermaid Nene and her pleas for help.\n\nThe duo finds themselves tasked with rescuing Nene's sisters, who are forced to sell their bodies in order to pay off their debts incurred from buying the expensive medicine that allows them to retain their human forms. Far from being beacons of justice and morality in this ruthless world, Tao and Alma simply do as they please.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
