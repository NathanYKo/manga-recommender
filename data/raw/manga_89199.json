    "synopsis": "Bell Teinburen is a sword-wielding monk and member of the Saint Beneze Hospital Knights, a group that provides protection and medical care to pilgrims traveling on the road. After entering the town of Brokken Brook, he intervenes in the would-be assault of a young girl, Ashe Talton, but is injured in the process. Noticing his condition, Ashe takes him back to her home, which doubles as a clinic. \n\nIn addition to receiving treatment for his wound, Bell observes further acts of kindness performed by the always expressionless Ashe. After accompanying her for a while, he expresses the naive desire to stay in town and see Ashe at the upcoming May festival. Little does Bell know that Brokken Brook's idea of a festival is a days-long, Church-sponsored witch hunt—and that Ashe is to be the latest girl put on trial!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
