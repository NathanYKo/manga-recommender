    "synopsis": "Good-for-nothing Momo lacks the ability to look after himself, and is the ultimate slut. Yata is the mothering type, a reliable but simple guy. The two get off to the worst possible start when Yata comes across Momo during a post-sex clean-up in a public restroom. Taking advantage of Yata's kindness, Momo ends up staying at his apartment. As he spends more with Yata, the once-slovenly Momo starts to change... But in the midst of this, Momo's previous \"owner\" shows up.\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
