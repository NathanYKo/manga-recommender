    "synopsis": "Average, unremarkable Ai Maekawa navigates school life unnoticed... until one day when a spiteful classmate totally humiliates her in front of everyone. Determined to jettison her embarrassing past, she overhauls her image and enrolls at a new high school where no one knows the old Ai. From the start, Ai is the target of romantic advances and jealous gossip—can a formerly invisible girl handle this avalanche of attention? And is Ai's erstwhile identity as a loser really as far behind her as she hopes?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
