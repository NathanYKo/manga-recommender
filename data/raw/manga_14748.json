    "synopsis": "Looks matter—that is what Yoshio Yoshida knows best. Due to his almond-shaped eyes, short height, and a scar on his face, Yoshida cannot get a girlfriend. Furthermore, all the girls at his school resent him because of his close relationship with Takahiko Satou—Yoshida's handsome, popular, and tall classmate. In reality, Yoshida does not understand why Satou is so attached to him, as they have nothing in common and barely know each other.\n\nEven so, one of Satou's fans tricks Yoshida into finding out who Satou considers his \"favorite\"—the only person he will ever date. However, instead of uncovering the truth, Yoshida is caught off guard when Satou kisses him. The next day, the confused Yoshida suddenly remembers who Satou is: his gloomy and overweight elementary school classmate whom he used to protect from bullies.\n\nImmediately afterward, Satou shows his true colors as a sadistic person and confesses his love for Yoshida. But being Satou's \"favorite\" might bring only more trouble to Yoshida's already complicated life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Kimi wa Happoubijin (You're Everyone's Friend)\nVolume 2: Kame no Koi wa Mannen A Tortoise's Love Lasts For A Thousand Years, Love is Swallowed Whole), Koi wa Marunomi (Love is Swallowed Whole)",
