Montblanc's popularity only grew in the years following the war, thanks to his dedication to nature conservation and his loving personality.\n\nFellow war veteran and robotic Europol detective Gesicht is sent to investigate Montblanc's tragic demise. In his pursuit, Gesicht uncovers evidence of a mysterious entity known only as \"Pluto.\" He also learns of a conspiratorial plot to dismantle the eight specialized robots from around the world who participated in the war. Racing against time to save those who still remain, Gesicht grapples with his memory, morality, and a world full of hate, desperately attempting to defend the fragile coexistence of man and machine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Celebrating the 50th anniversary of Osamu Tezuka's acclaimed Tetsuwan Atom, seinen mangaka Naoki Urasawa collaborated with Tezuka Productions to create a dark adaptation of The Greatest Robot on Earth story arc. The adaptation shifts the focus from Tezuka's protagonist, Atom, to his supporting character Gesicht in order to better ground the story in realism. Pluto won the ninth Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize and the Excellence Prize in the Manga Division at the seventh Japan Media Arts Festival in 2005. It also won the 41st Seiun Award for Best Comic in 2010. The series was published in English as Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka by VIZ Media under the VIZ Signature imprint from February 17, 2009, to April 6, 2010.",
