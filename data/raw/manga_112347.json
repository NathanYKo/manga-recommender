    "synopsis": "After attending an all-boys high school for three years, Kouhai has finally made his college debut. Happy to have greater freedom, he is ready to get a girlfriend and has practiced various pick-up techniques for his crucial first day. \n\nWhen he arrives on campus, he spots a beautiful dark-haired woman and approaches her holding a pack of cigarettes, ready to ask for a lighter and consequently strike up a conversation. As it turns out, she is actually his senior at the college and she immediately sees through his lousy attempt at attracting her interest. Despite his initial failure, Kouhai becomes infatuated with Senpai and is determined to make her his girlfriend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
