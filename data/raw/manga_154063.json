    "synopsis": "Mere moments before her death, Korean architecture student Yoon Dohee has an epiphany: those around her regard her as nothing more than a pushover and someone utterly undeserving of respect. A chance to turn her life around comes in the most unexpected form when she is reborn as Deborah Seymour, a brazen and scornful villainess from a dark reverse harem novel. When one of the male leads acquired a rare pink diamond for the heroine, Mia Binoche, Deborah's envy sparked an abusive campaign that eventually landed her in an isolated monastery.\n\nFor this incarnation of Deborah, being a villainess from such a prominent and wealthy family is living the dream. People expect nothing from her, and she gets to relax and be pampered to her heart's content. She is personally disinterested in the diamond, so she simply has to avoid crossing paths with Mia and her love interests. But if Deborah, as a noble lady, refuses to marry, she will meet the same pitiful ending regardless. To secure her independence, Deborah needs money and help—and a mysterious hooded information broker may prove to be her lifeline.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
