    "synopsis": "With the unexplained emergence of dungeons came a relentless onslaught of monsters that overwhelmed humanity. Even the Awakened, humans with special abilities to fight monsters, couldn't stop the destruction of the world. In the end, only Sungin Kim, the most powerful Awakened, was left standing. Upon his death, Sungin wakes up twenty years in the past as an unassuming high school student named Soohyun Kim. He's not sure how or why he was brought back, but he does know this is his second chance to save the world and redeem himself as a hero.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
