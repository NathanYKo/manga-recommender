    "synopsis": "As a caring and diligent father, factory worker Kwon Gang-Ho supports his family with the little that he earns. At his workplace, he is admired by everyone due to his benevolent nature. Meanwhile, in Seoul, Gang-Ho's wife Yeong-Ran looks after their children on her own. Despite struggling to keep the family afloat, she never neglects her kids and puts in all her effort to raise them.\n\nWhen Gang-Ho's carelessness gets him involved in an accident, it leaves his face with severe burn marks. Dismissed from his job afterward, Gang-Ho returns to Seoul. However, since he does not want his family to know about the mishap, he decides to stay at his friend's house for the time being.\n\nOne day, Gang-Ho encounters his daughter crossing the street. Suddenly, a car speeds forward and almost hits her, but Gang-Ho arrives in the nick of time and rescues her—wearing a mask of the fictional hero \"Gugu-man.\" Following this incident, Gang-Ho starts using the costume of Gugu-man to keep an eye on his family without ever revealing himself. Thus begins the heartwarming tale of a devoted father and his earnest endeavor to protect his family, all while having to face arduous circumstances of his own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
