    "synopsis": "Doing what he can to pay his bills, Moon Shingun works as a rogue mechanic on the city streets. He barely scrapes by with this illegal work, so he does not think twice about convincing ignorant people with cash to burn to always return to him for his services.\n\nThe streets are far from safe, however, with the organized crime group known as the Mercifuls fighting their rivals for control. With drugs and death becoming commonplace in his hunting grounds, Shingun is looking to keep his pockets full; and when he overhears a car failing to start, its sound leads him to Jake Gillan, a Mercifuls member. Finding himself facing a man dressed to kill and with a seemingly bottomless wallet, Shingun believes he has hit the jackpot.\n\nBut Jake is quick to catch on to Shingun's shoddy work, backing the scam mechanic into a corner. Determined to do whatever it takes to keep his cash flowing, Shingun agrees to hand over his body to the gangster in exchange. Little does Shingun know that his actions will lead him to become more entangled in the dangerous world of the Mercifuls than he ever was before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
