    "synopsis": "It has been several years since Mitsuomi Kozuka and Yamato Kumai became a couple. Living blissfully in the countryside, they are seemingly content with their relationship. However, while they can express their feelings for each other through gentle caresses and heartwarming gazes, the two find it difficult to exchange words of love.\n\nWhen Mitsuomi proposes the idea of a partnership—a non-legally binding version of marriage—Yamato is hesitant to take the next step forward. In their attempt to navigate through misunderstanding and worry, the couple ponders how to attain happiness without regret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
