    "synopsis": "Professional mangaka Rohan Kishibe has seen the blackest color in the world—and this elusive color is connected to an incident where a French translator, the curator of the Louvre's Far East art section, and two firemen disappeared without a trace.\n\nThree hundred years ago, a Japanese artist named Nizaemon Yamamura discovered the darkest pigment known to mankind. But because he cut down an ancient tree to retrieve it, he was executed. Following his death, it is said that a curse existed on every painting he used the color on, imbuing them with hatred. When Nanase Fujikura recounts the legend to him, Rohan is immediately intrigued and learns that one of Nizaemon's artwork had been saved by a curator, who took it to the Louvre.\n\nTen years later, Rohan heads for Paris to search for it. As he prepares to unearth the ominous painting from the archives, Rohan quickly finds that the curse is far more powerful than he could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Kishibe Rohan Louvre e Iku was the first manga by Japanese mangaka to be displayed at the Louvre Museum. It is also the first full-color manga Hirohiko Araki has ever done. The beginning pages of the manuscript were displayed from January 22, 2009, to April 13, 2009, as a part of the \"Little Design Exhibition: Manga World Showed in Louvre (The Louvre invites the comics).\" It was adapted into a live-action movie in 2023. The manga was later serialized in Japan in the Ultra Jump magazine from April 2010 to June 2010 and released by Shueisha on May 27, 2011. It was published in English as Rohan at the Louvre by NBM Publishing on April 1, 2012. It was also published in French by Futuropolis on April 9, 2010; in Italian by 001 Edizioni on December 8, 2012; and in Brazilian Portuguese by Pipoca & Nanquim on January 31, 2020.",
