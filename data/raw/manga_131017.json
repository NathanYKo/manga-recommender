    "synopsis": "An aromantic, asexual fujoshi and a closeted gay man have nothing in common, but that does not stop Yuriko and Gakurouta Hanazono from entering a sham marriage. Unable to understand romantic attraction, Yuriko finds solace in boys love media and desires to be nothing more than an observer in a romance. Meanwhile, Gakurouta harbors unrequited feelings for his heterosexual childhood friend Sousuke Kusama, who also happens to be the gardener for their estate. \n\nAs the couple strives to adapt to their less-than-idyllic union, Gakurouta learns more about his wife's interests, while Yuriko tries her best to hide her fujoshi delusions as she watches her husband interact with Sousuke. In the process, Yuriko and Gakurouta find a strange sense of comfort with each other. Although they will never develop romantic feelings for one another, their mutual understanding seems to bring them together in a completely different way than they ever thought possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
