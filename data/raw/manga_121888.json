    "synopsis": "In slasher horrors, the first to die is always the promiscuous girl. Whether it be in the midst of intercourse or as she is taking a bath, the movie takes the chance to show off her body, and then shamelessly kills her in a bloody and ruthless fashion. \n\nA young man in modern-day Japan wakes up in the body of Summer, one of five main characters in the movie \"18th Day Sacrifice.\" Unfortunately, Summer is the exact type of character who dies first: a sexy and experienced woman. Though the world seems out to kill her, Summer resolves to survive till dawn breaks and be the final girl to remain alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
