    "synopsis": "Resine de Poisson, orphan heir of an incredibly wealthy family, decides to attend the same boarding school as her late mother. However, due to her sheltered upbringing, she struggles to fit in. It doesn't help that she is put in the same room as the rebellious Simone d'Arc, who does nothing but tease and laugh at her.\n\nHowever, after fate decides to put the two in the leading roles of a school performance of Romeo and Juliet, the bond between them grows. Shiroi Heya no Futari explores the confusing relationship between a feminine goody-two-shoes and a tomboyish troublemaker.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "The Shiroi Heya no Futari one-shot was first published in Ribon Comic in 1971. In 1973, Ribon's publisher Shueisha compiled the one-shot into a volume of the same name, along with two other stories. In 1975, publisher Hakusensha reprinted the volume. Finally, in 1988, the publisher Kadokawa Shoten included Shiroi Heya no Futari in Volume 28 of their series of Ryouko Yamagishi's completed works. Shiroi Heya no Futari is generally considered to be the first manga of the yuri genre, influencing what would become the best known works in the genre.",
