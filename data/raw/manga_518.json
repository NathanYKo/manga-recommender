    "synopsis": "Follow the story of Tatsurou Shinozaki, a priest and private investigator who works to solve strange mysteries involving mystical influence. One day a woman comes to his church looking for the mysterious red penguin. She uses a post-hypnotic suggestion on him so that when the phrase \"red penguin\" is mentioned, he begins to hallucinate. As the journey to uncover the red penguin begins, secrets are uncovered about Tatsurou's past, including a shadowy society that may be linked to his suddenly unreliable memory.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
