    "synopsis": "After retiring from public fighting and getting fired from underground fighting, 27 year old Nozomi Tenma's zest for life is gradually dwindling away. It's hard to be at the bottom with nowhere to go, and that's exactly where she and her two friends are. However, Nozomi hits upon an idea that may just solve all of their problems: they could make their own underground fighting circuit for women, and tap into an underexplored market. As good as that sounds, her insistence on including the unknown quantity Hina Hongou may prove to be more than she bargained for...\n\n(Source: Comikey Media)",
