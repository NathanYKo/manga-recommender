    "synopsis": "Ever since she was a child, Midori has had a secret: she can see things that normal people can't. There is only one place where she doesn't have to hide her secret, and it is at that place that she has hazy memories of making a \"promise\" to a mysterious but beautiful young man. She thinks it may have just been a dream, but it was actually the beginning to a bewitching but sweet wedding...!\n\n(Source: Clairparfait)",
