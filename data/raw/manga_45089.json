    "synopsis": "In the first term of high school, Ikumi Sakono discovers a bizarre coincidence; in the seat just behind her is Touma Sakono. Although they are not family despite sharing their family name, their peers decide to give the pair a nickname—husband and wife.\n\nOwing to their similar natures, Ikumi and Touma get along well, which only strengthens the school's impression that they are more than friends. Their relationship develops when Touma approaches Ikumi for help, asking her to draw character art for an app he is creating. As the pair works together, only time and the project's success will tell what is to become of their friendship and whether or not it blossoms into something more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
