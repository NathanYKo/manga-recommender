    "synopsis": "Taking a step toward adulthood, Wataru Toda and Chiharu Saeki are now first-year college students who attend different universities. Upon entering college, Wataru starts working at a movie theater while Saeki gets a job elsewhere. Despite dating since high school, complications from school and work begin to create a distance between the two.\n\nWith fewer opportunities to see each other yet a determination to maintain a close relationship, they decide to follow their old tradition of watching movies together. Reminiscing about their high school days, they coordinate a special plan for the coming break. With summer vacation just around the corner, Wataru and Saeki set out to strengthen their relationship while enjoying a new chapter in their lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
