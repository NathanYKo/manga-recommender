But as they say...behind every successful man is the maid who keeps him from tripping over his own two feet! Enter Miss Kishi, the most competent, professional maid around—and the only thing keeping from Kiichiro quite literally crashing and burning. He owes it all to her, but can he ever make it up to her? He's sworn to try...no matter how many things must get broken, scattered, or lost to do so!\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
