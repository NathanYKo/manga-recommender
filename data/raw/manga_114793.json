    "synopsis": "Rojica and Rakkasei lead a cozy countryside life, exploring their world's whimsical, fascinating creatures. Through their scholarly friend Isaac, they learn about many bizarre human artifacts and the ancient civilization that once inhabited their planet. A vinyl record and a twister mat are just some of the items with mysterious purposes!\n\nWhen there is nothing else to do, Rojica and Rakkasei investigate their strange neighbors: the secretive C3, who crawls dungeons and slays strange beasts; the off-putting and incoherent Mrs. Grace, who terrifies Rakkasei; and Mrs. Massu, whose doting husband has never been seen by anyone. However, the hidden and darker sides of those around Rojica and Rakkasei tend to emerge unexpectedly, but, nonetheless, adventure never seems to end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
