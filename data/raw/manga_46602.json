The club's sole purpose is to cheer on their classmate Himiko, a battle angel who fights invaders from another world in order to protect humanity. Club leader and class representative Hayashi aims to keep its existence unknown, but that objective is challenged when a new male student, Daichi Oogami, transfers into their class.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
