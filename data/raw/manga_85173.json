But his life drastically changes one night when he is attacked by a mysterious girl, who plunges her teeth into his neck and begins drinking his blood. Upon satisfying her craving, she offers Makoto a simple choice: become like her or die.\n\nWhen he wakes up in a hospital after his encounter, Makoto is unable to deal with the blindingly bright lights and finds that water cannot quench his growing thirst.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
