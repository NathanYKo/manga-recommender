But Marleen, a pianist at a bar he frequents, is interested in him and just won't take no for an answer. When Coyote unexpectedly goes into heat for the first time, Marleen catches him while he's unable to maintain his human form and offers up a tempting invitation. Coyote wants to resist, but can he?\n\n(Source: SuBLime)",
