    "synopsis": "After a night of drunken revelry, 19-year-old Kouta Satou decides to relieve himself near a seemingly secluded temple. Meanwhile, an angel is attempting to seal the queen of the underworld into a holy ball with his bow. Unfortunately, he misfires, trapping her instead inside of Kouta's unwitting balls. The angel departs, leaving Kouta a dire warning: if he fails to resist ejaculating before the end of the month, the queen will be released and mark the end of the world.\n\nFor the lustful Kouta, such a commitment is easier said than done; on top of using any means necessary to resist temptation, he must also guard himself from advances made by Elyse, a lesser devil who would resort to drastic measures to free her queen. In Oretama, the fate of the entire world rests upon the improbability of one man's chastity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: There are five specials: Extra Ball 1-3 and Special Ball 1 &amp; 2 are coupled with the tankoubon releases.",
