    "synopsis": "A lonely \"demon lord\" and a self-centered \"hero\"!?\n\nWhat about \"villager A,\" caught in the middle!?\n\nThis is a school that prepares people for roles in fantasy stories. However, those who possess the \"traits\" of a \"warrior\" or \"wizard\" are but a few. Most will become no more than mere \"villagers.\" I, Satou, am also one of those \"villagers\"; but one day, a girl possessing the trait of \"demon lord,\" Ryuugamine Ouko, set her eyes on me. She's short and a surprisingly calm, good girl, but she'll abruptly mutter about destroying mankind; give me a break. Taking up the opposition with passion is my childhood friend, Hikarigaoka Tsubasa; she's more trouble. This girl is also quite the beauty, but as soon as she makes up her mind, she's an absolute troublemaker...\n\nThis is a world that's slightly abnormal, with a slightly abnormal cast, interwoven in their dilemmas; a slapstick comedy!",
