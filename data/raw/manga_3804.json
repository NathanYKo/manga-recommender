One Mochizuki Kaoru hides from bullies chasing him inside a fortunetelling shop owned by one Kagami Kyouko. Kyouko tries out one of the spells she's been studying on poor, meek Kaoru and the results brings out more than just Kaoru's aggresive persona. The charm's side-effects also makes Kaoru blessedly-equipped not to mention perpetually ready to keep on going. Kyouko uses and studies Kaoru under the guise as one of her \"assistants.\"",
