    "synopsis": "A freshman at Yuasa's college who's studying craft &amp; design, Satoru Arimura, is a seriously perverted hand fetishist. Their hands accidentally brushed in the library, and now he thinks it's fate! He says Yuasa has \"the hands of his dreams,\" and keeps coming to see him (well, his hands) every day, bugging him for photos, sketches, and studies!! While annoyed at first, Yuasa realizes how serious Satoru is about his craft, and ends up letting him sketch his hands. One day, Satoru sees Yuasa cut his finger, and insists on licking the wound to \"disinfect\" it... which makes Yuasa's heart race! Although, Yuasa does freak out at the bulge in Satoru's pants while he's going down on his finger!! Satoru's laser-focus on Yuasa's hands starts changing to an interest in Yuasa himself, while Yuasa's getting frustrated at Satoru's fixation on his hands... Will their relationship take a turn for the romantic...?\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
