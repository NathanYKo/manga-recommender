    "synopsis": "Kami, who is gay, has given up on love. Despite not having anyone to share his cooking with, he always makes a ton of food. And along comes Waki, a good-looking TV announcer who hosts \"Waki Travels! Waki's Happy Food Corner!\" Although he's got no taste buds, he eats a ton and comments on the food he finds in people's homes. But he takes an interest in Kami's food and even goes to visit him at his workplace. While he's able to slowly open up to the big-hearted Waki, he's still unable to be true to his feelings when he's afraid of getting hurt again...\n\n(Source: Libre, translated)",
