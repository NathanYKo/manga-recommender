    "synopsis": "Over a decade after the Thousand-Year Blood War, Ichigo Kurosaki lives a peaceful life with his wife Orihime Inoue and their son Kazui. Utilizing the fledgling Soul Reaper powers inherited from his father, Kazui assists those burdened by the deceased much like Ichigo did as a teenager.\n\nOne day, Ichigo receives an unexpected call from his married Soul Reaper allies Renji Abarai and Rukia Kuchiki. The couple invites him to take part in the \"Konso Reisai\"—a ceremony in which a Hollow, an evil spirit from the human world, is sacrificed to honor a Soul Reaper captain who died exactly 12 years prior.\n\nUnbeknownst to Ichigo and his friends, something sinister looms over the Konso Reisai. As Renji meets up with Ichigo to honor the dead, the two are interrupted by the return of an old enemy they never thought they'd meet again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
