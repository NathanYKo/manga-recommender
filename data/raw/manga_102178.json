    "synopsis": "Junichirou Mikado may be taciturn and serious at work, but he goes all out when it comes to his secret passion—he is actually an idol fanboy, a fact he carefully hides from the world. His room is a testament to his embarrassing commitment; it is more or less a shrine to his favorite idol, the walls covered with her posters and CDs littering the space. With almost equal fervor, Mikado hates his work superior, Misaki Anezaki, who is competent at his job but hardly tolerable as a boss and a person. From digging into Mikado's stash of cup noodles to mercilessly pushing all his grunt work onto his underling, Anezaki's list of crimes is never-ending. But Mikado's perception of his boss as a no-good pain in the neck is about to change when he is forced to retreat to a love hotel with the drunk, out-of-control Anezaki to escape a downpour—and wakes up in the middle of the night to find his superior doing some pretty unspeakable things to him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
