    "synopsis": "Allen, an eight-year-old boy from a poor family in the royal capital, is living a poor but happy life together with his mother. One day, however, memories of his previous life suddenly come back to him and he remembers that he is in an dating sim game and that the capital will be destroyed by war if he doesn't do something about it. If this continues, both he and his mother will be killed!\n\nWith a sense of urgency, he decides to rise to the occasion in order to save his precious mother's life and save his favorite character, the villainous young lady Anastasia, the only girl he liked in the game, from her all too tragic and ruinous end.\n\nThis is the story of a man who isn't even a character in the game, but who strives with his steely determination and uses all the knowledge he has to turn overcome fate!\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
