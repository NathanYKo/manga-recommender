    "synopsis": "All throughout his life, Jun Kushida has been able to see deceased people. After the death of his childhood friend Ryouko Hayakawa, Kushida notices that, unlike the other ghosts, she follows him everywhere. Although Ryouko never speaks, she gestures in order to help Kushida escape terrifying situations that his eerie powers will not let him avoid.\n\nAfter a friend convinces him, Kushida reluctantly joins the local History Club. As the club investigates spine-tingling past events, Kushida wonders if it is the right place for his psychic abilities and meek nature. Life-threatening circumstances only seem to increase, but Ryouko is always there to point out exactly what will save Kushida's life and assist him in unraveling the horrors of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 4: Yumi-chan Kitan (The Mysterious Tale of Yumi-chan)",
