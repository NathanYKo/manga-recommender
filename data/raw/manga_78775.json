    "synopsis": "A boy wakes up one morning only to realize he has become Hatsuko Fukatsu, a second-year high school girl. As he tries to find his own body, most of his attempts only seem to draw suspicion from those around him, as Hatsuko's idiosyncrasies make pretending to be her rather difficult. Now forced to live out Hatsuko's day, the boy starts to wonder if he will ever be able to locate himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
