    "synopsis": "Due to her father's six million yen debt, sixteen-year-old high school student Fumi Oono and her father are evicted from their apartment. In need of a place to stay and a job to earn money, she starts to work as a live-in housekeeper for the young writer Akatsuki Kibikino.\n\nWhen they meet for the first time, the two start off on the wrong foot, with Akatsuki calling Fumi useless and treating her like a child. Determined to pay off her father's debt, Fumi works hard to prove him otherwise. However, despite Akatsuki's foul-mouthed and mysterious behavior, she begins to realize that he is not as despicable as she initially thought, gradually unravelling the passionate and caring person underneath.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 7: Hirunaka no Ryuusei Bangai-hen: Blue\nVolume 8: Hirunaka no Ryuusei Bangai-hen: Red",
