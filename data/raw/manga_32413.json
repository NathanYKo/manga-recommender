    "synopsis": "Lance is a devil punished to guard the gates of Heaven and Hell and to lie to souls to get them into Hell. He can never tell the truth because to do so would mean he will disappear. He has to send one more soul to Hell before he can finally be free from his punishment. For a devil, lying is easy, right? But what happens when the soul of the person he cherishes walks up to the Gates for judgement?\n\n(Source: Aerandria Scans)",
