    "synopsis": "Tokyo has fallen into a post-apocalyptic state, ravaged by war. On the outskirts of the capital, two girls have taken residence in an abandoned military tank at a dry riverbed in the Suginami Ward. Mandara Legrand, who speaks like a broken tape recorder, lives alongside Becchin, a paranoid girl who deals with hallucinations of her life before the war took her world away.\n\nLeft to fend for themselves, there is no one left in the war-torn town that can help them survive the aftermath of destruction. Alone, they combat the undead, hunger, and boredom with what little supplies can be scavenged from the wreckage of the capital. The two girls struggle not only against their surroundings, but with their own sanity—as they work together to stay alive in the deteriorating pastoral countryside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
