    "synopsis": "Shiina, a female college student, is dating Shuu, a coppersmith. For many years, Shiina has heard the rhythm of Shuu's hammer striking copper. Unable to know what he is thinking, she continues to watch him hammer away, as he has always done. However, one day, Shuu suddenly proposes to Shiina! With marriage in mind, Shuu will come to realize that love and craftsmanship may very well be correlated with one another.\n\n[Written by Phloup]",
