The worst of the bunch is Kima, who is the ace of the team and has a bad attitude. He had decided to put up with it until graduation but is suddenly kissed by Kima. After that, Kima kisses him and also suddenly acts distant, and his feelings are unknown. All that makes him think that Kima has feelings for him...\n\n(Source: Media Do International/Printemps Publishing)",
