Aristine is a princess imprisoned all her life, not allowed to be in front of the emperor. But the fact is that she possesses of the \"The King's Eye,\" allowing her to see both the future, the present and the past. She becomes the scapegoat for a political marriage, marrying a fearsome barbarian...\n\n\"The most precious things should be given to my wife.\"\n\nThe person who will soon become my husband seems very strange, but it is much more ordinary than I thought.
