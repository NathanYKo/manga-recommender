    "synopsis": "In this world, every child is born under a god. Some gods are weaker than others. Some gods are stronger than others.\n\nChildren born under weaker gods become defunct in society, and cannot attend high school. Instead, they must get jobs after middle school. High school in this world is a place that trains students to use their stronger gods. They have one thing in common: They can grant wishes if the correct price is paid.\n\nLeerang turns back time a day, and pays dearly for it. To reverse his wish, he must attend high school and try to use the powers of his cat god once again.\n\n(Source: MU)",
