    "synopsis": "Getting rejected by her crush was the best thing to ever happen to Moe. After finally confessing to the popular and attractive Yuuka, Moe is shot down with exceptional cruelty. Yuuka not only rejects her feelings but also reveals a truly mean personality by casting insults and demanding that Moe stay away from her. From then on, Yuuka acts cold and unkind—glaring at Moe in class and berating her when they are alone.\n\nThis, however, does not affect Moe, who has actually been aware of Yuuka's true character from the start. In fact, that is exactly what Moe likes about her! No matter how harsh and critical Yuuka is, Moe's love only deepens, as the passionate abuse does nothing but fill her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
