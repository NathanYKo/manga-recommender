    "synopsis": "Hinata Asahi is a high school student who lives alone with only her teddy bears to keep her company. Her life becomes much more exciting when the handsome Shirou Asou, moves in next door—not only is he really cute (even if much older), but he's also her new teacher! Hina has a bit of a crush on Asou-sensei, but when the older man seems to take an interest in her as well, is it a forbidden love or something else?\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
