    "synopsis": "Does hell exist? Only those who have met the Hell Girl, Ai Enma, know for sure. It is said that if someone accesses the Hell Correspondence website at midnight, they can type in the name of the person they hold a grudge against—and, subsequently, Hell Girl will take that person to hell.\n\nHowever, what most people do not know is the price of such an act: in order to send someone to hell, the requester's soul is damned as well. But is any price worth paying to see vengeance exacted on one's enemies?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
