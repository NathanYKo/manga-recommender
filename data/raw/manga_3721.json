    "synopsis": "Ogata Aoi is in her 2nd year of middle school and is the president of the student council. The middle school she attends is one of the best in the country and is called \"AAA.\" Aoi goes there to meet her first love, but after a surprising meeting, she's finding out that her first love is a gang leader in the neighbor school, called \"CCC\" (lowest level). Maybe it's only a coincidence that that gang leader and her first love have the same name since they look completely different from each other, but now, Aoi wants to find more about this person....\n\n(Source: Divine Sanctuary)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: CCC",
