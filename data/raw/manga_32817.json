    "synopsis": "A mysterious, creepy, and unwelcoming mansion is the perfect home for Alicia Fatilin, a girl of noble descent. She takes delight in looking at dark-themed decor and reading eerie ghost stories, always speaking about terrifying incidents without hesitation. Her demeanor is no surprise to anyone who knows her as \"The Princess of Death\"—the bride whose fiancé died at their wedding ceremony. Despite Alicia's gruesome reputation, she holds a high status among the noble families as the sole daughter and surviving member of the Fatilins.\n\nDue to her lineage, Alicia finds herself marrying the grand duke of Azberg, Kashburn Licen. The duke's true intention seems to be politically motivated as he seeks to cement his newly noble position for the sake of his kingdom. Even so, the two exchange wedding vows during their first meeting and quickly establish their union. But trouble takes no time to arise from this new relationship, making Alicia's second marriage seem rather grim.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
