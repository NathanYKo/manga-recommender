    "synopsis": "Private detective Reiji Akiba has a theory about those awkward moments and weird coincidences we all encounter in life. They are actually encounters with the dead; it's their way of sending us a message. But you may not want to open such strange mail from beyond—not unless you can see the ghostly attachment like Akiba can, and not unless you carry a gun that can kill what isn't alive like Akiba's aptly named Kagutsuchi—the tool between God and earth—digging a divine grave to lay to rest the evil dead.\n\n(Source: Dark Horse Comics)",
