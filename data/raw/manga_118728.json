    "synopsis": "All alone, 18-year-old Yoon Taemin has had to fend for himself his whole life and learn how to survive in a cruel world. He tries to shake off an unusually vivid dream of a boy committing suicide and getting hit by a speeding truck. But the dream turns out to be a vision of his fate—as he dies the exact same way.\n\nFollowing the accident, Taemin wakes up in the body of Min Siwoon, a meek and frail teenager who jumped off a building. Although Siwoon is surrounded by wealth and loving parents, it is soon evident that everyone, even his brother, absolutely despises and viciously bullies him since he is unable to stand up for himself.\n\nAccepting his new situation, Taemin lives on as Siwoon, protecting himself under the excuse that he lost all his memories. However, his past life quickly catches up with him when he encounters Han Siwon—his childhood friend—who is nothing like the weak boy he used to be. Siwon instantly recognizes that it is Taemin in Siwoon's body, and the circumstances that led to their ultimate falling out slowly start to unravel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
