    "synopsis": "Tsuji and Aizawa have been friends for years—until one day, out of the blue, Aizawa kisses Tsuji and confesses that he’s in love with him. Tsuji wants to stay just friends, the way things have always been between them—after all, love can be messy, and things are just better keeping the status quo—but will they really be able to do so, or is it love or nothing between them?\n\n(Source: MU)",
