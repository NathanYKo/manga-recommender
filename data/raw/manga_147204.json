    "synopsis": "Chrono Life harbors many players' favorite aspects in virtual reality games: the freedom, excitement, and exploration of a new world. Meanwhile, Lee Ji-u is incredibly frustrated by the game; although he spends a fortune on a sword, nobody seems to want him in their party—they berate his inexperience and shabby equipment. However, his spirits are lifted when Luna invites him to join her party. The two seem to get along well until they arrive deep in the forest, where Luna kills and ridicules Ji-u.\n\nDistraught and dejected, Ji-u tries to upgrade his items, only for them to be destroyed by unsuccessful reinforcement attempts. A passing newbie sympathetically gives Ji-u a wooden stick, which he also reinforces—however, by some miracle, the stick does not break and reaches the game's maximum level of +99. With a single tap on the ground, the stick rips the continent in half, breaking the world record for players killed in an instant.\n\nFrom his belittled, depressed beginnings, Ji-u becomes one of Chrono Life's most powerful players—his feats changing his life and the game forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
