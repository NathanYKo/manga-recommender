    "synopsis": "Yuu Sonoda and Haruka Takayama have been the best of friends since middle school. Now, the two girls attend Misato West High School together and are even placed in the same class, but their seats are far away from each other. With the school officials announcing the closing of the school in three years, they resolve to make the most of their time there and create more memories with each other.\n\nHowever, a misunderstanding makes Haruka jealous of Yuu, causing Haruka to run away. Yuu follows her and apologizes. They share a kiss, crossing the boundary of being friends, and then begin a deeper relationship with each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
