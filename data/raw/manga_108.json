    "synopsis": "Snow surrounds the 17-year-old Kazahaya Kudou while he fights not to lose consciousness amid the freezing landscape. Luckily, a cold-blooded young man named Rikuo Himura saves him and brings him to his boss, Kakei, owner of Green Drugstore. Out of necessity, Kazahaya agrees to become Kakei's employee.\n\nHowever, Kazahaya's job is not limited to organizing shelves and dealing with customers. Due to his ability to see strange things, Kazahaya is commissioned to complete dangerous assignments in exchange for money. Begrudgingly paired, Kazehaya and Rikuo—who also seems to possess unique powers—must take on these missions while confronting ghosts from the past that are hunting them down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
