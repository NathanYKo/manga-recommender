    "synopsis": "The past has changed, but like a fiery comet, he still comes. Mugi Hwa, the one without equal, slashed through Murim's skies with his sword, toppling every lord who dared to face him—even Cheonma, Mugeuk Geom's father. But Mugeuk didn't accept defeat. Instead, he turned to the forbidden: a time-bending ritual that hurled him into his own past. Now, retracing his steps, he races against the clock until Mugi emerges once again. But this time, it's not just about power, but mending old wounds and forging new bonds to unite his people and prepare for the bloodtide to come.\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
