    "synopsis": "Sealed in ancient jewels are the spirits of the heroes who tried and failed to unite China in the Three Kingdoms era. These jewels have been scattered throughout Japan, and have the power to draw out the full potential of those who inherit them. However, those owners, known as Toushi, are possessed with an insatiable appetite for battle. Hakufu Sonsaku is one such Toushi. Living in the country, Hakufu's desire to beat something to a pulp goes unfulfilled until her mother tells her to go to Tokyo, where she starts training with other Toushi and sets foot on the path to her destiny.\n\n(Source: TokyoPop)",
