    "synopsis": "An innocent boy being strangled to death by the person he was fond of—this is the nightmare that haunts Terumichi Hoshino. Lately, Hoshino has been having this recurring dream, and the next time he comes to school, events akin to his visions unravel in front of his own eyes.\n\nThese occurrences begin when Hoshino's life intertwines with the charming and enigmatic Omihiko Yamada. Their feelings are completely mutual, and their relationship as classmates quickly transforms into an intimate one. When they are about to make out, a stranger lunges at Yamada with killing intent and slaughters him without remorse. Horrified by the horrendous sight, Hoshino attempts to save his slain lover, only to witness Yamada rise from the dead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
