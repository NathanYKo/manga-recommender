    "synopsis": "The boyish Satsuki Satonaka is a social butterfly living in a small town. Since childhood, Satsuki has been attached to Takumi Kusuki, who once helped her out in a pinch. One day, when she visits Kusuki, she stumbles upon pornographic magazines in his abode.\n\nAs Satsuki sees all the erotic actions portrayed in the magazines, she gets the desire to act them out with Kusuki, but he refuses. Feeling as if Kusuki does not consider her a proper woman, Satsuki decides to seduce him by tempting him in a lewd way that even he cannot ignore.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
