These top-two-ranked old pros come to realize that navigating this game world is much harder than just pointing and clicking. With the apocalyptic conclusion of the game looming before them, they'll have to combine his quick wit, her foul mouth, and both their gamer mindsets to make a new, less cataclysmic ending.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
