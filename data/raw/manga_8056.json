    "synopsis": "Chihiro drifts through life with no purpose going from girl to girl until one day he finds an abandoned kitten in a box. He quickly falls in love with little Shiro and couldn't imagine his life without her. One evening, Chihiro finds Shiro has fallen ill. While searching aimlessly for an animal hospital, he runs into Kumazawa, a local vet who takes Shiro into his care. Watching Kumazawa in action, Chihiro realizes he wishes to learn the value of life and asks Kumazawa to consider hiring him at the vet clinic. Kumazawa agrees, but only as his live-in housekeeper. Has Chihiro finally found his purpose in life or will living with the handsome vet be a little too much to handle?\n\n(Source: SuBLime)",
