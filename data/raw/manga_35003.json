    "synopsis": "A junior at Suzaku High, Ryuu Yamada is infamous for being a hardliner and a delinquent. One day, after being reprimanded for his poor performance and attitude toward school, he spots Urara Shiraishi, the grade's top student. As Shiraishi is walking up the stairs, Yamada attempts to provoke her, only to trip and fall, taking her down with him. \n\nEventually, he wakes up in the infirmary. To his surprise, he discovers that he is not in his own body. It turns out that he swapped bodies with Shiraishi, and upon confronting her, he finds out that the catalyst for the swap was an accidental kiss during the fall. With the knowledge of this new ability, Yamada's eventful high school life has just begun!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
