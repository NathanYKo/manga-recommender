    "synopsis": "Japan is a brilliant Asian model of success. But how would this country manage were they to face a large-scale sanitary crisis? What would it happen if, in Shinjuku—one of the biggest districts of Tokyo—a man came only to bleed out in the street in broad daylight? How would the political and sanitary authorities manage the drama? \n\nThink, please, about the question for as long as you have the possibility of doing so because for the professors Onodera and Sekiguchi, it is already too late! An emergent virus has begun to insinuate itself into the arteries of the Japanese capital.",
