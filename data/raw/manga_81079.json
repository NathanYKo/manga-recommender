However, on the day of their first date, Ayumi receives a call from her unpopular and dull classmate, Zenko Umine, who tells her that she will jump off a roof momentarily. Losing consciousness, Ayumi wakes up at the hospital and discovers that she has switched bodies with Umine.\n\nIn an attempt to get her life back, Ayumi tries to tell everyone about the strange phenomenon despite her different appearance. However, as no one believes her, she is ridiculed by her classmates. When Umine comes clean with Ayumi, she tells her that she has always wanted to live the life of a popular girl and will never swap bodies again. Irritated but determined to return to her normal life, Ayumi vows to take back her body, friends, and boyfriend from Umine no matter what.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
