    "synopsis": "On a day like any other, high school student Kokoro Aomi runs into Makoto Shirabe in a school corridor. What follows is nothing short of strange: Makoto asks her out, and on the spur of the moment, Kokoro says yes. Neither knows the other well enough to even be friends, and yet they end up as an impromptu couple!\n\nKokoro's friend Mika Totsuka advises her against being with someone she barely knows, but Kokoro cannot help but be drawn to Makoto's kindness―not to mention how adorably shy he acts around her. As Kokoro gradually gets over her own qualms of getting together with Makoto, she yearns to open up to him and hopes he does the same.\n\nHatsukoi Maze is a sugar-sweet high school romance that captures the essence of first love and all the exciting experiences that come with it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
