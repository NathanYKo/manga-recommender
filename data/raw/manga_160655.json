    "synopsis": "Ever since Kang Seol was a child, he's had strange dreams where he and several people wear masks while playing \"World of Eternity,\" a board game full of quests and adventures. And although Seol was great at the game, he was never able to win. But now, his dreams have become reality, and humans have become game pieces. Humanity's only hope is for Seol to recall what he did in his dreams to survive. Even though he's never won, will he be able to turn the tables and finally make his way to victory?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
