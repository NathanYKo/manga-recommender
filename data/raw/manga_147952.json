    "synopsis": "Life in Korea in the 21st century is all about looks—and social media influencer Do Remi knows it best. For no reason other than being beautiful, Remi has over a million faithful devotees who blindly adore her online. Her regular job is a plastic surgery consultant, and with her loyal best friend Lee Jia by her side, Remi is invincible. That is, until popular social media stars start to go missing.\n\nWhen Remi's stalker attacks Jia, Remi faces her new reality. Jia has vanished, Remi is a possible serial killer's next target, and the police twiddle their thumbs, refusing to take her plight seriously. As people close to her suddenly drop their masks and evasive figures offer help, Remi is uncertain she can truly trust anyone but herself—but she will do anything to remain alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
