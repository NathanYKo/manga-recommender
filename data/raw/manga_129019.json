    "synopsis": "Yuuki and Natsuha are childhood friends who live in the same apartment complex. Due to their intimate bond, there are constant rumors of the two going out together. Nonetheless, their time in high school is on the brink of ending, and they both expect to graduate without a romantic partner—that is, until Yuuki suddenly suggests they start dating!\n\nDespite the abrupt shift, their long-lasting friendship swiftly turns into passionate love. With college on the horizon, Yuuki and Natsuha only have a few months left together. Having missed many past opportunities to share their affection for one another, the couple resolves to quickly understand their new relationship in order to make the most of what remains of their high school romance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
