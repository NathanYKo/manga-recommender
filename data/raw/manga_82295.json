    "synopsis": "After suffering from horrific harassment at the hands of her classmates, Ayana Fujisawa has learned to simply remain quiet and wait for it to be over. However, when the bullying escalates and she is purposely pushed into traffic, Ayana is admitted into the hospital. She realizes that if she doesn't fight back, things will only get worse—and eventually, she might even be killed.\n\nIn Ayana's mind, there is only one option: brutal revenge on those who have ruthlessly bullied her, those who have stood idly by and laughed, and those who have done nothing to help her in her torment.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
