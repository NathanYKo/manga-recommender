    "synopsis": "Neneko has the power of a \"miko,\" but she avoids all people due to their reactions to the animal ears on her head. In her loneliness, she made herself a shikigami, an attractive man named Shichikage. One day, she's invited to work in a clinic with other miko, and she decides to go, hoping especially that she can find a way to get rid of her ears and then live an ordinary life. Once there, she meets the other miko and their shikigami, and starts her new lifestyle—making new friends and dealing with the difficulties of being a miko!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
