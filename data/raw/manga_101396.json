    "synopsis": "Yoshikazu Miyano is a meek high school student who enjoys reading boys-love manga. One day, he finds himself in a predicament of stopping a fierce school fight, unsure of what actions to take. Before everything gets worse, he is interrupted by upperclassman Shuumei Sasaki, who boldly takes his place and saves Miyano from his grief. From that day on, Miyano has quietly looked up to him.\n\nHowever, three months later, Miyano realizes that Sasaki is more bothersome than admirable. At school, Miyano is greeted by him with playful teases, not to mention the frequent friendly skinship he receives. When Sasaki asks for manga recommendations, Miyano lets him borrow a boys-love comic he owns. Surprisingly, Sasaki ended up enjoying its content and got hooked on boys-love as well, marking the start of a shared passion. Could it develop into something more?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
