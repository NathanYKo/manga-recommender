Her only method of communicating her thoughts and feelings is through senryuu—a form of haiku which utilizes the 5-7-5 format.\n\nSurrounded by friends such as the misunderstood ex-delinquent Eiji Busujima, stalkerish and eternally single club president Amane Katagiri, shy but talkative artist Kino Yakobe, mysterious Tao Hanakai, and Eiji's self-proclaimed \"big sister\" Koto Ootsuki, Nanako's high school life has never been more enjoyable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
