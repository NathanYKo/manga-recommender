    "synopsis": "Kyoichi's always been a lady-killer, so no one is more surprised than him when he falls in love with another man. But even though Kyoichi cares deeply about Imagase, he can't help but have a weakness for women. When a young lady at Kyoichi's work gets a crush on him, it tests the bond between Imagase and Kyoichi. Can the two stay afloat in these troubled waters, or will the current tear them apart?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
