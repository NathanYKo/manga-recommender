    "synopsis": "Madoka Kawahara has always fawned over the boys she reads about in her manga, and it is her firm belief that the best guys are always cute. Adorable, innocent, and sweet—there is no greater combination! However, to her utter annoyance, it is a guy with the exact opposite personality of Madoka's type who comes to work with her in her family's restaurant.\n\nDespite his handsome appearance, Momoki Shikura is cold, arrogant, and utterly indifferent to Madoka's several attempts at kindness. Every interaction between the two has been unpleasant, with Shikura constantly making it seem like Madoka has ulterior motives to get closer to him. However, as the two spend more time in each other's company, they begin to realize how misleading first impressions can be. As the days go by, Madoka starts to wonder if Shikura may have a cute side to him after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
