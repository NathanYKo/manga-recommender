    "synopsis": "Satoko is a domestic girl with a kind heart. She lost her father when she was little, and her family has become very poor ever since her father's company went down. However, \"life is happy enough when you're optimistic about everything\" as Satoko enjoys her daily life heartilly. One day, she was rescued by Fuuma, an extraordinarily matured 10-year-old boy, from a mad dog. Little did Satoko realize that this boy is the head of Wakudera Corporation, as well as her future husband! \n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot: \nVolume 1: Karenai Hana (Undying Flower)",
