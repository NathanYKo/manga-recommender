    "synopsis": "This is a story of a boy who challenges free diving.\n\n\"Free diving (skin diving)\" may remind you of the film Le Grand Bleu. It is an extreme sport, and each meter added to its record brings us closer to the seabed and further from the surface where one can breathe again. In this sense, free diving has a direct connection with death, with which our fight continues, refashioned over time, bit by bit. So, why would one free dive, and risk their life? The answer lies within \"mysterious bond between the sea and humankind.\" And in the fast-evolving world of competitive diving new data emerges that casts light on this bond.\n\n(Source: MU)",
