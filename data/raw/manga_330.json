    "synopsis": "Shi-Hyun is a girl who has nothing but bad luck - at least, that's what everyone believes. In some ways, Shi-Hyun herself believes this and tries to stay away from the people she loves the most. As a result, she has developed an outer shell, making her look tough and indifferent even with the constantly bullying. But when she transfers to a different high school, a fresh start brings unfamiliar characters - and new challenges - into her life.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
