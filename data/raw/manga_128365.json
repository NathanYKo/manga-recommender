    "synopsis": "The self-conscious Shizuku Hoshikawa is on her way to dispose of her first and last novel. But before she can do so, the charismatic Kaori Asaka bumps into her and ends up taking the novel home. This turn of events greatly distresses Shizuku, as she does not want anyone to read the depressing story she wrote for her own satisfaction.\n\nInitially expecting the worst, Shizuku finds herself in tears of joy when Kaori tells her the novel deeply moved her. Kaori wishes to read more of her stories, but as Shizuku did not plan on writing anything else, she has no idea what to write. As a result, Kaori comes up with a bizarre suggestion—their love.\n\nShizuku is skeptical of Kaori's intention and somewhat uneasy about what secrets she may be hiding behind her smile. Nevertheless, the two begin their odd summer vacation in pursuit of their own love story.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
