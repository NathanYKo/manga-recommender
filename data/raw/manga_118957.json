    "synopsis": "Knowledgeable, dignified, and beautiful, Letizia Charriere is the pinnacle of noblewomen, yet she stoops so low as to harass the girl that her fiancé, Crown Prince Dion Allenflal, favors. After he annuls their engagement, Letizia's lips turn upward... it all went according to her plan. Years ago, the studious Letizia had discovered her marriage to the prince could incite a civil war, potentially tearing the country apart. So, she diligently worked all these years to have him break off their engagement. \n\nHowever, before Letizia can leave the scene, the king collapses, causing a flood of memories to flow into her head. She recalls a place called Japan, where she lived as a nurse protecting people. Unable to turn her back on someone in need, she uses these memories to perform CPR on the king and resuscitate him. \n\nThe matter finally settled, Letizia goes to live in the countryside, lazing away each day with alcohol and food; but this respite from politics and duty is short-lived. The arrival of Second Prince Claude Allenflal marks the start of a new series of trials for the young noblewoman, and as she works toward living a life of luxury and ease, Letizia makes a name for herself as an unparalleled healer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
