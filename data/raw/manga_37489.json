    "synopsis": "One quiet morning in an empty classroom, Saki Momota gathers all her courage to profess her love for the very first time―only to be rejected. In an attempt to hide her broken heart, she excuses herself, intending to change the water of the flower vase she is holding. Momota makes a sharp turn on her way out and splashes the fragrant liquid all over Ryuuichi Akai, a scary-looking student whom everyone fears.\n\nDespite wishing to avoid Akai since the incident, Momota ends up running into him while picking up her brother from kindergarten. It turns out that Akai's niece is her brother's fellow kindergarten and good friend. Their meeting lets Momota see Akai in a new light and find a way to heal her broken heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
