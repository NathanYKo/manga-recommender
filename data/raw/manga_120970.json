    "synopsis": "University student Kwon Eungi has little interest in pursuing romantic relationships. Aloof, unapproachable, and serious, he prefers to remain on the sidelines while his best friends discuss love. His only hobby is the dying classical guitar club, which he hopes to revive with the upcoming batch of freshmen. Luckily, among the new students is Choi Jeongwoo—an adorable embodiment of sunshine who seems immune to Eungi's tough exterior.\n\nThrough guitar lessons and frequent outings with mutual friends, Eungi and Jeongwoo continue to cross paths. After learning about Jeongwoo's recent breakup by chance, Eungi develops an odd desire to ensure that Jeongwoo is well and soon accepts that it might be an indication of a burgeoning romantic attraction. Even when he notices that his feelings might be reciprocated, Eungi—who has never felt this way about another man—approaches their relationship with caution, but it only grows harder to keep his distance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
