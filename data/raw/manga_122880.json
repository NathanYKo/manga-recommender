    "synopsis": "Tomoko Aoyama has a sneaking suspicion that her son Hiroki is gay. He often talks excitedly about boys and men before he realizes it and bashfully tries to explain himself. From fawning over handsome baseball players on TV to talking highly about his best friend, Daigo Shiraishi, Hiroki inevitably becomes flustered by these casual slips of the tongue—much to his mother's amusement. Though she has no way of knowing for certain, Tomoko can only wait and quietly support her anxious son until the day he is ready to say something.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
