She finds the perfect place for rent—affordable, spacious, lovely garden included—but there's one catch. The house comes with a live-in landlord! It's disappointing enough that Asako can't have the single life she hoped for, but her cute landlord also seems to be hiding a big secret...Will living together bring them closer, or turn out to be more trouble than it's worth?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
