    "synopsis": "In the span of a single night, human history was redefined. Destroyed and rebuilt anew, New York City was transformed into Hellsalem's Lot, a metropolis blending humdrum city life with that of The Beyond—a mystical realm transcending human comprehension. Three years later, humans and otherworldly beings have managed to coexist in a city where violence and mayhem have become commonplace. Surrounded by a near-impenetrable barrier of fog, exchange with the outside world is strictly regulated, keeping the mysteries of The Beyond well-contained within. To maintain a balance, the secret society Libra protects both the city and the outside world from its dangers.\n\nLeonardo \"Leo\" Watch, a victim of Hellsalem's Lot's unpredictable madness, was bestowed with The Eyes of God, a supernatural gift that grants him superhuman sight but at the cost of his sister's eyesight. Having stayed in the city to research his condition, Leo seeks out Libra as his next lead. However, the organization finds that Leo's abilities can aid them in their cause and inducts him into their ragtag group in exchange for their assistance. Now an unlikely member of their team, Leo accompanies the fearsome but pure-hearted leader Klaus von Reinherz and the other colorful members of Libra on dangerous, high-stakes missions to ensure the safety of a city that never sleeps.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
