    "synopsis": "Giancarlo \"Gian\" Bourbon del Monte lives life at his own pace. It matters not if he is thrown in prison, because rest assured, he can leave whenever he wants to. As he is still deciding whether to give up his life of leisure behind bars, the unthinkable happens—four out of five captains of CR:5, the Italian mafia he belongs to, are arrested and incarcerated near-simultaneously.\n\nGian knows of the captains—Bernardo Ortolani, Ivan Fiore, Luchino Gregoretti, and Giulio Di Bondone—but is familiar with only one, given that he holds a much lower rank in their organization. Therefore, it seems like a joke to be told that he has suddenly been promoted to their level. Furthermore, if he can successfully jailbreak the entire group, then he will become the next CR:5 boss. In spite of his confusion, Gian does not lack ambition, and he is not called \"Lucky Dog\" for nothing. He has no doubts about the future that awaits him once he brings his new friends to freedom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
