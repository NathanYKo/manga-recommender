    "synopsis": "Dealing with abuse and depression since she was young, Mariko Ikagawa sought solace in Tomoyo Shiino—the start of a friendship that continued until adulthood. Now a 26-year-old office worker, Shiino is baffled when she hears a newscaster report that Mariko has killed herself. Though Shiino doubts the news at first, she accepts the truth after being unable to contact Mariko and begins to wonder the reason behind her suicide.\n\nLooking to free her from her despicable father, Shiino impulsively steals Mariko's remains from him. Reunited with her dear friend, Shiino travels to a certain location Mariko wanted to visit, all while remembering their happy memories together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot: Yiska",
