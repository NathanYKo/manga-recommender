Her wealthy grandmother is shocked at Yenni's behavior, and decides to change the financial arrangements for the money she's leaving to her granddaughter in her will: Yenni will only inherit her grandmother's hefty fortune if she ceases the loan-sharking business ... and if she marries an honest man!\nIf she fails, her grandmother's fortune will be given to her friend's grandson, so the pressure is on for Yenni to give up her usurious ways...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
