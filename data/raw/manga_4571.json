    "synopsis": "Shirayuki is Tanbarun's friendly neighborhood herbalist, whose unique red hair ends up drawing unwanted attention from the vain prince of Tanbarun, Raji Shenazard. Faced with the unattractive proposition to become his concubine, Shirayuki chops off her hair and flees the country overnight. In her journey deep into the forest, she encounters Zen Wistalia, the prince of the neighboring country of Clarines. When Zen takes a bite out of a poisoned apple that Prince Raji sends in order to recapture Shirayuki, she expertly uses the herbs at her disposal to cure him.\n\nTogether with Zen and his two friends, Kiki and Mitsuhide, Shirayuki travels to Clarines, where she aims to make a life for herself as an apothecary of the royal court. As Zen slowly begins to mean more to her than the prince of her new country, the two of them must learn to work together toward their respective dreams despite the difference in status.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Hachigatsu no Shikisai (Colorful Seasons of August)\nVolume 2: Bokura wo Tsunaide. (Connect Us)\nVolume 13: Shizuku no Saki ni (Beyond the Drops)\nVolume 14: Natsuyasumi 00-nichime (00 Days of Summer Vacation)",
