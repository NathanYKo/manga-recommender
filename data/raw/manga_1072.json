    "synopsis": "In the year 1863, a time fraught with violent social upheaval, samurai of all walks of life flock to Kyoto in the hope of joining the Mibu-Roshi—a band of warriors united around their undying loyalty to the Shogunate system. In time, this group would become one of the greatest (and most famous) movements in Japanese history... the Shinsengumi!\n\nInto this fierce milieu steps Seizaburou Kamiya, a young would-be warrior who, though lacking in combat experience, possesses a fiery enthusiasm to both aid the Mibu-Roshi in their mission and to avenge his wrongfully murdered family. One of the Mibu-Roshi's most gifted (and immature) swordsmen, the legendary Souji Okita, agrees to take Seizaburou under his wing. What no one suspects, least of all Souji, is that Seizaburou is actually a girl named Sei Tominaga in disguise!\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 45: Ooedo Shinsengumi!",
