To add on to her troubles, Kouichi Saonji, the young landlord of her apartment, approaches her and requests that she prepare to vacate since she is now be unable to pay rent. Alternatively, Kouichi proposes a solution: he and Sachi will get married and she will act as his caretaker.

But will the newly wed couple be able to fall in love, or will they remain strangers forever?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Sayonarakakushi",
