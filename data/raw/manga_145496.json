    "synopsis": "Haruki Homura lives in solitude in the snowy countryside of Hokkaido. Hiding all his emotions in his lonely heart, he can not help but detest the bleak, colorless world around him.\n\nOne day, Haruki meets the outgoing photographer Akihito Narumi, who came from Tokyo to capture the elusive snow fairies with his camera. With no place to stay amidst the snowy conditions, Haruki decides to let Narumi stay at his house for the winter. As the affable photographer cracks open his host's frozen heart, Haruki slowly warms up to the beauty of the world around him. Gradually developing a close bond, these polar opposites begin to dread the arrival of spring, as their time together will come to an end once the cold winter passes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
