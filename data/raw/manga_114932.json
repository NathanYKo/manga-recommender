    "synopsis": "Within a quaint mountain village in 18th-century Tibet, 13-year-old Kang Shiva is preparing to one day inherit his father's position as the town's doctor. Absent-minded and obsessed with herbs, Kang has never considered falling in love and marrying, despite being at the right age to take a bride.\n\nWhen a girl named Mosh Rati comes from afar to meet her future husband, she stays with Kang's family at their house. Mesmerized by her beauty, Kang thinks about how lucky the man who marries her will be. But to his surprise, she is his intended bride! Between a doctor-in-training and a young lady from a foreign country, a blossoming romance is bound to form.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
