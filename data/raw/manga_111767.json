    "synopsis": "Shinichi Honda is a student with no filter for his words or his actions. A first-year high school student, he is noble and kind but as blunt as a brick, tending to speak his mind with no hesitation. Attending the same school is Mako Wakamiya, a member of the public morals committee with an incredible sense of duty. From a distance, she appears to be cool and collected, but hidden in plain sight is the fact that she is a total klutz with a maiden's heart.\n\nThe first time Shinichi and Mako lock eyes, they are each wholeheartedly caught up in their own awkward situation. The brief moment when they pass by each other only leaves them dumbstruck at the other's strange appearance.\n\nMonths later, disaster strikes when Mako, on committee duty, must confiscate an adult manga from Shinichi. Hilarity ensues as Shinichi leads Mako on a thunderous chase all over the school. As the deafening pair happen to meet up more and more often, maybe there is hope that the two can get along?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
