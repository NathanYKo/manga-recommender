    "synopsis": "Shouta \"Take\" Takeuchi has suffered from severe asthma since he was young, missing school for long periods of time whenever he was in the hospital. Having grown resentful of the normal student life he cannot have, he dislikes attending classes even when he is healthy and believes that he has no need to make friends. Despite his aloof demeanor, Take is approached by Youhei \"Macchan\" Matsuki one day. Slowly but surely, Take begins to look forward to their interactions and realizes that he may be romantically interested in Macchan.\n\nAs Macchan and Take spend more time together, their close relationship becomes evident to schoolmate Haruko \"Umeko\" Umezawa. Tasked with looking after Take by both their mothers, Umeko considers him a childhood friend through circumstance rather than choice. However, she sees a new side to the usually ill-tempered Take when he is in Macchan's presence. Moved by his kind words and actions, Umeko also naturally starts to feel attracted to Macchan.\n\nAcknowledging each other as rivals for Macchan's heart only seems to strengthen the bond between Take and Umeko. As the years pass, even if they never act on their feelings, the two refuse to regret falling in love with the same person.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
