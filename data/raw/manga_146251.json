    "synopsis": "Ochiai is a gloomy woman who constantly belittles herself. Following her divorce, she moves into a new apartment and becomes neighbors with Sawatari, a cheerful man slightly younger than her. After Sawatari saves Ochiai from a drunk man, the two begin to meet frequently. As Sawatari's kindness melts her fears and worries away, Ochiai's long-lost happiness starts to return once more—her saddened heart now filled with many warm, sincere emotions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
