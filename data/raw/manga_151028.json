    "synopsis": "A hangover leads to a shared life between a thief and a slave girl.\n\nHarris is an adventurer who works as a thief and scout, a job that is often shunned due to poor reputation.\n\nOne day he gets drunk and buys a slave girl, Tiana. Tiana, who had been treated badly and not given enough food until then, comes to adore Harris, who treats her kindly, as her master. Harris, who had been hoping that Tiana would grow up to be a beautiful woman, is gradually drawn to her because of her innocence.\n\nHarris' life changes drastically when he begins living with Tiana: warm meals, freshly washed clothes, and interaction with the townspeople who had never come close to him before. On the other hand, he finds himself in more and more troublesome situations, will he manages to escape from them with his skill and tact...?\n\nThis is the story of the \"rebirth\" of a shabby thief, which begins with an encounter with a slave girl.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
