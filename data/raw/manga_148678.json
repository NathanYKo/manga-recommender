    "synopsis": "At the brink of death on an otherworldly battlefield, Jihoo Seol is granted the chance to relive his life. But all magic has its limits, and Seol only retains a few fragments of the man he will become. Memories of a future he has yet to live manifest in sporadic dreams and magic grants him unearned luck. When his magic fails, Seol's life takes a turn for the worse. Desperate and alone, he's approached by a mysterious woman with an offer that will change his life forever. Will his dreams be enough to save him from the horrors that lie ahead?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
