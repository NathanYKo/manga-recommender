    "synopsis": "Alexander Plutinov: Master of martial arts, President of the Republic of Prusia, and beloved leader worshiped by his citizens. His insatiable desire to ride and conquer all manner of things—beasts, machines, and even a nation—has forged his path to triumph. One fateful day, as he heads to work astride his faithful pet tiger, the president is targeted in a terrorist attack. Naturally, he fends off his assailants without breaking a sweat, but a bizarre accident that happens in the aftermath knocks him out cold. When he finally wakes, the president finds himself in another world full of monsters and magic! Orcs, wyverns, and even centaurs... It's a whole new world for Plutinov, and he's ready to RIDE ON into the adventure!\n\n(Source: Sol Press)",
