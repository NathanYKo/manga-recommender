    "synopsis": "Eunha Noh lived only so he could die, but he only lived because he couldn't die. Having lost his family, he had closed off his heart. He wanted to die fueling his hatred for monsters. Eventually, he drew his final breath in a black dungeon named The Abyss. One of the dungeons humanity deemed unclearable. But a miracle occurred, regressing him to when he was a baby. Truth be told, he wanted to live. He was searching for a reason to live, but the life of hatred and destruction he walked had held him back. Eunha decided that this life would be different. He'd do anything to survive and be happy.\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",
