    "synopsis": "It has been one month since samurai Soujirou married the charming Chiyo. Despite their marriage being prearranged by their parents—enough reason for anyone to be dissatisfied—Chiyo has been a courteous wife who handles her household affairs with ease. Bewildered by her beauty and great capabilities, Soujirou could not ask for a better partner! But there is one thing that bothers him: Chiyo forces a smile whenever he is around.\n\nConvinced that his wife despises him, Soujirou swears to become a good husband who can make Chiyo genuinely happy. Little does he know, his wife loves him much more than he could imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
