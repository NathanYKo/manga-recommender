    "synopsis": "In Route 20 people live in a metal city surrounded by a glass dome, that protects its inhabitants from the polluted air of the outside, and controlled by a paranoic and oppressive police state. They feel free and sure, albeit they are like imprisoned. But some \"rebel\" boys have different feelings. Ushiji is one of them, a boy that follows his dream... or, better, rides his dream: his motorcycle and its metaphoric meaning of freedom, with the memories of his grandfather's tales about the absence of rules and hypocrisies of the outer world.",
