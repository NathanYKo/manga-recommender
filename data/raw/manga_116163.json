    "synopsis": "There's a new school nurse at Mitsugi Middle School, and the students couldn't be more ex­cited. To everyone else, Momoyama-sensei is an unmatched beauty, but second-year student Tamotsu Kurita sees something they don't—that she's also a massive nerd! Her love of 2D characters—and only 2D characters—knows no bounds, and try as she might, she just can't hide it. To Kurita, being around a beautiful lady who shares his interests is a dream come true, but Momoyama-sensei's more excited to talk about her favorite fictional idols than anything else...\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
