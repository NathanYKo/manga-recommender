    "synopsis": "Twenty-three-year-old Hina currently lives with her boyfriend Teppei. Although the two are deeply in love, there is one thing that they have clashing opinions on: baths. Naturally, Teppei would like for Hina to bathe every day, but the latter hates baths, finding them to be too much of a hassle. This prompts him to devise various strategies that always end with his stubborn girlfriend in the bathtub alongside him, creating sweet and bubbly memories for both of them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
