    "synopsis": "Fumihiko Matsumaru, a single 26-year-old average salaryman, invited a girl to the movies but was stood up. Right at the moment he was about to toss his tickets into the trash, a cute girl appeared and asked him not to waste them. After movie and dinner, he escorted her home, only to find her apartment was burning. Having nowhere else to stay, 20-year-old rookie seiyuu Aka Onda moved into Matsumaru's place, and the two started a \"more than friends but not yet lovers\" relationship under the same roof—with many obstacles waiting for them.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Gin no Machi Romantic (Silver Street Romance; 2 parts)\nVolume 4: HanaQ-ban Shin Angyo Onshi",
