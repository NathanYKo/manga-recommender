    "synopsis": "Makoto has always had twisted desires. Outcast from a young age due to his abnormal hobbies, he attempts to summon a demon to fulfill his wildest fetish—to feast on its guts. What he wasn’t aware of, however, was that he would summon the charismatic and dangerously beautiful Archduke of the Demon World, J.\n\nJ offers him any wish in exchange for his soul, and Makoto is finally able to make his most wicked desire come true. However, the chatty Archduke takes a liking to the terrible Makoto and turns him into a demon—vowing to raise and adore him in Hell. Makoto must now learn the delicate etiquette of the Demon World or suffer the consequence of his ignorance: having his soul ripped apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
