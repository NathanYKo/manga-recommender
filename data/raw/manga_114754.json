    "synopsis": "The four heroes are on their way home after their final confrontation with the Demon King. Led by the talkative mage of the group, Nina, they head to the other heroes' hometown of Pocca. On the journey home, she reminisces about her past as a stray orphan and the family she found consisting of the hero and his two companions. However, despite the warm atmosphere on the surface, dread looms over Nina as she thinks about the villagers' reactions to their long-awaited return. After all, the news she has to deliver may not be something they would like to hear...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
