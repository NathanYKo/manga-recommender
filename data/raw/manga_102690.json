    "synopsis": "Logic puzzle genius Akira Shiroyanagi and many others are plucked from modern-day Japan and thrown into an unfamiliar room. With shackles around their wrists, they are informed that no one will miss them, the world believes they are dead, and they are the new test subjects for groundbreaking research. The research in question entails abilities that can enhance a body's capability and bend the fabric of reality. Most are left quaking in fear, but Akira can't help but find the challenge exciting.\n\nEach of them is given an ability unknown to anyone else and is soon thrust into various trials. Nothing is off the table from fighting one-on-one duels to large battle royales—not even death. As the group comes to grips with the dreadful turn of events, Akira determines to outsmart everyone standing in his way and unravel the enigma surrounding this mysterious organization.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
