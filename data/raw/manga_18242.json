    "synopsis": "NEETs are usually people who have chosen not to be part of society due to personal problems or just straight out laziness... This story centers on a certain special girl that would have become a NEET right after high school without even realizing it. It's not that she doesn't want to get any job, but it seems that there is not a job out there that can fulfill her very special job criteria... At least her mother understands her.",
