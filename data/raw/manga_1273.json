    "synopsis": "Our heroine, Ruu MACHIDA, is having a hard time. Her mother died when she was little, and her father, with whom she had been living, has disappeared without a trace after getting into debt. Ruu is on her own.\n\nTo make ends meet, she takes a job as a live-in maid for a very wealthy household. To Ruu's surprise, the house she ends up working at is the home of three cute brothers, and she already knows one of them! They agree to let Ruu work there because they are often alone and they could use the help. Their parents are often away on business. Ruu moves in and works hard as a maid, and they all become very close. But things aren't always smooth sailing. Ruu has a lot of pressure on her because of her father's debts, and three very cute guys to deal with!\n\nVol 2 included one-shot: Watashi no Sugar Baby",
