    "synopsis": "Ethics is a term used to describe principles that aim to determine whether a person's behavior and actions can be justified as right or wrong. Takayanagi is a high school teacher who is in charge of an elective course that focuses on ethics. Despite not having a full class, he aims to teach his students about the importance of moral philosophy. Many students that attend Takayanagi's class are dealing with their own issues, and by engaging in his lessons, they learn to approach their problems from a different perspective.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
