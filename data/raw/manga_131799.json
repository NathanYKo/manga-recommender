    "synopsis": "University student Jung Bareum always has her days planned. She lives her life to its fullest efficiency and carries out her aims without fail. But while her rigid lifestyle pays off, she lacks one thing: romance! When asked about relationships, Bareum uses her busy schedule as an excuse. However, once Shin Jaehyun, her handsome schoolmate, enters her life, Bareum has a chance to get on track with dating.\n\nBareum joins Jaehyun's small programming club spontaneously in hopes of seeing him more frequently. However, her path to achieving love is not all moonlight and roses. She crosses paths with Na Yuyeon, a fellow club member who likes online games and tends to be late to class. Just by comparing their ways of living, Bareum believes the two will not find any compatibility. But despite being polar opposites, there may lie something special underneath. How can Bareum juggle her schedule, romance, and annoyances?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
