    "synopsis": "Like other students, Yuuya Matsuda is a bystander to the cruel bullying Naoto Wakatsuki suffers at the hands of Akira Kaneshiro and his lackey. Due to foul rumors, everyone fears the erratic Kaneshiro and does not dare to defy him.\n\nOn Yuuya's balcony, unusual objects always mysteriously appear. This time, he finds a piece of newspaper seemingly from the future. The headlines state that by October 2, a murder will occur; the culprit will turn themselves in and then take their own life while in custody. Yuuya pays no mind to this until, later at night, he encounters Naoto holding a bloodstained baseball bat. Naoto makes a shocking confession: he has killed Kaneshiro.\n\nTired of being a bystander, Yuuya decides to hide Naoto in his room during the course of the investigation. But once they are discovered, the boys have to leave town and take cover elsewhere. If Yuuya wants to save Naoto from his fate, he must change Naoto's mind before October 2. However, Yuuya soon learns that both Naoto and his crime are not as clear-cut as he initially thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
