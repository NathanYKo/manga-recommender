    "synopsis": "Freshman high school student Mako Mochizuki is easily prone to getting lost, especially whenever engrossed in the world through the lens of her film camera, a hobby she has had since she was young thanks to her beloved grandfather. Now that her grandfather is gone, Mako feels she lacks direction when fellow photography enthusiast Kei Akahoshi invites her to stay at Hasumi Inn, his high school's local boarding house. The building is also known as \"Lens Inn,\" as all of the housemates are part of the school's photography club, so Mako decides to take a shot at her childhood friend's offer, using the opportunity to find new sights as well as herself.\n\nWhile on her way to the inn, Mako catches sight of a puppy and starts to take a picture of it only to accidentally capture the long-haired boy walking with the animal. Later on, as Kei guides her around the manor, she learns that the puppy was the inn's residential pet, Omochi, and that his human companion–who Mako gave a bad first impression to–was Mitsuru Amemura, a fellow first-year. Despite his apparent dislike of having his picture taken, Mako discovers a photogenic side to Mitsuru, allowing a friendship of the two to slowly come into focus.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
