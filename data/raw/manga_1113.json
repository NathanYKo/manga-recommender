    "synopsis": "Ion Tsuburagi has always believed that her \"jinx\"—chanting the letters in her name—brings her good luck when she needs it. While running away from one of many attempts by the student council president to make her his girlfriend, Ion falls into the arms of Mikado Hourai—the president of the school's unofficial Psychic Powers Research Club.\n\nNaively falling in love with him after learning about his childhood dream, Ion finds herself joining Mikado in his psychic research endeavors, whereupon she stumbles across an object he was experimenting on—a strange, deep blue stone. When she picks it up, the stone shocks her; she instinctively chants her jinx, and as a result, flies up into the sky! Believing the object to be lost, Mikado decides to continue his research efforts nonetheless, using Ion as his test subject in its place!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
