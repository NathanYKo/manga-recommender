    "synopsis": "While returning home from the convenience store, Subaru Natsuki suddenly finds himself standing in an unfamiliar city, surrounded by unfamiliar people speaking unfamiliar words. Subaru quickly connects the dots and realizes that he's been transported to another world. After being chased off by a shop owner for being penniless, Subaru finds himself surrounded by a group of thugs.\n\nJust when Subaru thinks all hope is lost, a mysterious girl named Satella comes to his rescue. She's after a thief who Subaru had previously seen in town. After Satella scares off the thugs, Subaru decides to repay her by helping her look for the thief.\n\nThrough a series of events, the pair finds themselves at a cellar known for housing stolen goods. Shortly after entering the house, Subaru and Satella are ambushed by a dark figure and neither survives the encounter. Subaru opens his eyes to find that he has gone back in time to earlier that day, beginning a confusing series of loops in which he relives past occurrences.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
