    "synopsis": "Self-centered, prudent and down-to-earth Sakaki finds his peaceful days wrecked by an inner storm when he gets completely attracted to, who he considers the forbidden, a straight man. Well, it doesn't come as a surprise when Okada, a dark haired stylish beauty, calls his attention in their first meeting; Okada is truly a jewel in the crowd, and Sakaki is very appreciative of a well-groomed man. Besides, just watching can't do any harm...right, that is true unless you have to keep meeting that person and working together for weeks. More to Sakaki's pain, even if he tries to avoid Okada, the man seems to have an unusual interest in him. It might be the sort of professional admiration that can turn into a good friendship, but Sakaki recognizes some signs that might say otherwise. However, even if there seems to be some hope, Sakaki is sure that's just a delusion on his part. Could he be mistaken?\n\n(Source: Queen2408)",
