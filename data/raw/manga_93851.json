    "synopsis": "Fuyunosuke's been living the good life in Tokyo. In fact, he's almost got the whole \"being human\" thing down. His brother Natsutaro, on the other hand, can't figure out the first thing about blending in on this strange planet. There's still a lot they don't know about humans, but with any luck, Fuyunosuke might just be able to show his bro that life on this little blue ball isn't so bad after all.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
