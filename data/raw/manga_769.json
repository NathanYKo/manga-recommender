    "synopsis": "Freelance photographer Akihito Takaba is famous for his daring work in field journalism, willing to do anything to ensure the perfect shot and the exposure of evil. On the other hand, Ryuuichi Asami is an elite businessman, known for his chain of high-class nightclubs and entertainment facilities. At least, that's what he appears to be. In reality, Asami is a powerful figure in Japan's underworld, playing his hand in everything from drug smuggling to government scandals.\n\nWhen Akihito sets his viewfinder on Asami's illicit dealings, he has dropped himself into a field he cannot escape from. Asami is not about to let his image get tarnished by a stubborn 23-year-old and will ensure that Akihito is taught a lesson. But Asami has severely underestimated the boy's determination to overthrow him, and suddenly, the two of them find themselves playing an obsessive game of cat and mouse. It is never quite obvious who is the predator, and who is prey.\n\nHowever, when Akihito's job puts him into the sights of an old acquaintance of Asami's—the leader of the Chinese drug syndicate Baishe, Liu Feilong—there seems to be more at stake than a couple of incriminating photographs. Instead, Feilong puts everything on the line in an attempt to use Akihito to draw out the wrath of the man he hates most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Finder Series was initially licensed in English by Central Park Media under its Be Beautiful imprint until the company's bankruptcy in 2009. Only 3 volumes were released. Digital Manga Publishing, under its Juné imprint, acquired the license and released the first volume on September 8, 2010. In 2015, the publisher launched a successful Kickstarter to restock the first six volumes of the series. The license was lost in June 2016 when the publishing agreement between DMP and Libre Publishing had ended. The following month, VIZ Media picked up the license under the SuBLime imprint and published the 8th volume on March 14, 2017. They have been republishing the series as Finder Deluxe Edition since June 13, 2017.",
