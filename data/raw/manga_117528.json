    "synopsis": "When a kind boy helps her out of a sticky situation on a train, Urara Andou falls for him at first sight. But before she can make a move to know more about him, his stop arrives and he exits the train. Over the next few days, all Urara does is regret her inaction and think about the what-ifs.\n\nWhile filling in for a classmate at a committee meeting, Urara meets Jun Misono, a rather abrasive classmate. She is busy trying to avoid Jun's attention when another boy walks up to him―none other than the one who saved her on the train!\n\nAfter learning that his name is Aiji Okaniwa, Urara plans to get closer to him so she can get rid of her regrets once and for all. However, just as she tries to act on her wishes, Jun does his best to thwart her efforts and remind her of the futility of her actions. With Jun around to make her feel low, Urara realizes that her pursuit of love is not going to be easy at all!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
