    "synopsis": "Sena's been tossed into another world, as the despised daughter of a noble family. Her little restaurant was her refuge in her last life, so she's got some tricks up her sleeve—cooking skills! As Senianna, she'll put her brains and fine-tuned taste buds (Korean fried chicken, anyone?) to the test so she can take back the kitchen and gain this society's esteemed title of Chef Royale. Will her cuisine reign supreme over the empire and bring her the sweet and salty balance of power and affection?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
