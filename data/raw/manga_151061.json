    "synopsis": "Falling drunk after failing the civil service exam again, Ryu Gunwoo is shocked to wake up in a motel with an unfamiliar appearance. Somehow, not only is he inhabiting the body of Park Moondae—a 20-year-old orphan who took his own life—but he has also regressed three years into the past. Furthermore, he is unable to find information about his original body anywhere.\n\nRecovering from his surprise, Moondae wonders if his present situation is similar to the action fantasy novels he knows of. To test his theory, he calls for a status window, which actually appears, albeit bearing the worst news possible: \"Debut or Die.\" Unless he debuts as an idol within a year, he will perish.\n\nTo avoid his deadly fate, Moondae must secure a spot on the idol survival show Idol Inc. and improve his abilities to the maximum. Due to his past job as a paparazzo, at least Moondae has some insight into the idol experience. However, one wrong step could put his future career—and entire existence—in jeopardy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
