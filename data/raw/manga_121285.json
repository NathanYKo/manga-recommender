In his never-ending quest to earn enough money to feed his two cute housemates, he takes up his greatsword and goes out to hunt every day. One day, while chasing an onigiri he accidentally dropped, he trips and falls into a hole... that takes him to another world?! Many strange things await him on the other side... Elf girls? Legendary dragons? Oh, and he's still the strongest, even in these new worlds...?!\n\n(Source: Square Enix)",
