    "synopsis": "Akari Kohinata finds the classmate who sits next to her, Yuu Hoshikawa, cuter than any other girl she has ever met. However, Yuu has one small problem with this: he is actually a boy and in love with Akari, but he believes that his feminine features make her oblivious to his feelings. In order to resolve his predicament, Yuu makes an effort to flaunt his masculine side to Akari, but that only makes him cuter!\n\nWhile Akari has an overwhelming admiration for her classmate's charm, Yuu firmly believes that Akari is much cuter than him. As they spend more time together, the pair only grow more enamoured with each other. After all, each finds the person sitting next to them to be the cutest one of all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
