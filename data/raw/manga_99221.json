    "synopsis": "Accepting his superior's recommendation, interior designer Oumi Jouno pays a visit to a fabled tailor shop in the back of an antique street. He is skeptical about the shop's stellar reputation; apparently, an urban legend is making the rounds that donning their suit will bring instant success to the wearer. The shop's interiors may be classy and to die for, but his initial impression of the surly, blunt owner, Tetsuya Shida does nothing to improve his opinion—especially when Shida refuses to prioritize Oumi's order and calmly tells him to wait an entire month! Oumi is quick to leave, vowing never to visit the shop again. However, one glimpse at the tailor's gentle smile while he works is enough to intrigue the stubborn interior designer and bring him back. Joou to Shitateya is the story of what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object—and falls irrevocably in love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
