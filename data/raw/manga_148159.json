    "synopsis": "Being called a freak isn't so bad when you have a spunky little black blob as a companion. An explosion leaves Nam Kang orphaned, scarred, and nearly blind, but he toughs out the daily bullying with the help of his imaginary blob friend, Inky. Until one day, Nam wakes from a bad beating to find his scars healed and his vision restored. At a new school, Nam is finally given the chance to live life as a normal kid. But it isn't just his scars that have disappeared. His best friend Inky is gone, too.\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
