    "synopsis": "Waking up inside your favorite novel sounds like a dream come true. Unless you're born as the hated villainess, that is. Our new, full-fledged Louise Sweeny must try to reinvent her character to dodge her doomed fate of being killed off at the end of the story. It seemed easy enough at first, but there's one big problem. The story, which she knew like the back of her hand, has veered so far off course that she can't predict what plot twists are coming next. Can she avoid getting in the way of the male and female leads' romance to save herself from impending demise?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
