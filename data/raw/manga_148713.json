    "synopsis": "In Ergosphere Online, a VR MMORPG craze, Oreum Lee is harshly mocked by his party members for being a mediocre healer. Not only that, his teammates in the game bully him in real life at school. Oreum's saving grace is his alternate character, a powerful Avenger class character that he plays with extraordinary skill. One day when Oreum logs out of the game, a glitch in the system imbues him with his alternate character's abilities and forces him to fight against evil monsters from the in-game realm. Will Oreum survive the game world and his school life at the same time?\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
