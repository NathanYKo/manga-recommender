    "synopsis": "For his 15th birthday, Note is gifted an inferior version of the skills \"World Map\" and \"Area Map.\" In other words, a trash skill. Soon after, Note's childhood friend obtains extremely powerful skills and turns her back on him. Having been abandoned by the childhood friend he secretly had feelings for, he lives his days in misery while trying to earn a daily income through adventuring.\n\n\"...We need that skill of yours.\"\n\nHowever, his life changes when a young man named Jin approaches him. This is the story of a boy named Note, who—with no cheats or skills of his own—joins a party full of the strongest cheat-like skills and sweats, fights, and struggles his way to dungeon domination. A story of that kind of growth.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
