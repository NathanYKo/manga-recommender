    "synopsis": "Here we get to follow a story about Sawaragi from Takaga Koi daro. \n\nHaving been sentenced to 5 years in prison for dealing drugs, yakuza Kyousuke Sawaragi just wants to finish his sentence and start a nice normal life far away from his past. So after parole, when he literally runs into former cellmate Shuuya, he's in no hurry to renew their acquaintance. Fate seems to have other ideas though, having the yakuza and Shuuya repeatedly cross paths with him. Can he really turn his back on all of it, especially if it holds out his one chance at finding true love? \n\n(Source: Dangerous Pleasure)",
