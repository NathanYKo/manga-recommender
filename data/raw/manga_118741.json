    "synopsis": "With his first year of high school on the horizon, Namito Taira planned to make the most out of this new period of his life. But what he did not account for was that he would be sitting next to Youko Furi, a blonde girl possessing all the characteristics of a delinquent. Thus, upon meeting her, a single glare from Furi immediately struck fear into his heart.\n\nHowever, contrary to Taira's beliefs, Furi is a sweet and adorable girl—with a big crush on him! Even so, every interaction between them ends with misunderstanding, and Taira continues to believe that Furi is nothing but a delinquent. Regardless, the time shared between Taira and Furi never fails to be lovely, leading the pair on the path toward a wholesome relationship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
