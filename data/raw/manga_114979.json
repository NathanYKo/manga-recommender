    "synopsis": "Ruri Rokuse enjoys his part-time job as a janitor as he is not forced to talk to strangers, which he finds challenging due to his stuttering. Furthermore, he looks up to Tooru Takashina, an office worker in the same building as Ruri. Tooru, when in front of a crowd, speaks articulately and without hesitation. Despite his wishful thinking, Ruri knows he could never conduct himself as well as Tooru does.\n\nWhen he receives Tooru's lost flash drive at work, Ruri musters the courage to talk to the man he admires before running away. Although surprised, Tooru does not seem to mind his stammer and wants to express his gratitude somehow. He gets the chance to do so when he reencounters Ruri. Will they be able to communicate properly with each other's help?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
