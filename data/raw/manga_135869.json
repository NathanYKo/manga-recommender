    "synopsis": "Nana loves shoujo manga and enjoys fictional romance more than real-life love, as she gets flustered easily with any slight interaction with the opposite sex. At least she's aware of her \"naive\" nature, until her classmate, a delinquent named Sutaka, confessed his love to her out of the blue...! Since then, his straightforward displays of affection have kept her heart pounding non-stop...!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
