    "synopsis": "Seventeen-year-old Hoon Lee is a hikikomori who attends high school and resides in an unpaid rental apartment. As if being bullied at school is not enough, Hoon's mother passed away due to illness, leaving him in the care of his cruel father. Eventually, the boy is abandoned with an insurmountable amount of household debt.\n\nNot having even one person to rely on, Hoon resolves to end his misery through the quickest method—suicide. Thus, he meticulously prepares himself to succumb at the hands of death. However, the very second he experiences pain, he finds himself faltering from the choice he has made. Soon, he encounters various people who may or may not hold the best intentions for him. Despite his conventional attempts of committing an atrocious act to himself, Hoon lives to fight another tough yet uneventful day.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
