After the sudden, gruesome death of the Monou siblings' mother, Kamui was taken away from Tokyo by his own mother. In the years that passed, the two lived peacefully while Kamui strengthened his innate telekinetic abilities. When his mother passes away in 1999, her dying wish prompts him to return to Tokyo to face his "destiny."\n\nWhen Kamui reappears in the city, his attitude has taken a drastic turn, and he displays the growth of his powers through violent confrontations in the streets. Various opponents come after him asking if he is "Kamui," but they seem to be demanding something far more significant than his name.

This wish is exceedingly optimistic due to Chiyuki's heart condition, which increases the risk of seizures and decreases her life expectancy. The doctor who presided over her birth said she would be lucky to live 15 years.\n\nChiyuki is 17 years old when she meets the unlikely vampire Touya Kanou. He claims to hate blood, and he refuses to find a human partner with whom to share the rest of his life. Touya is 18 now, but if he took blood continually from a partner, then they both might live to be a thousand years old. \n\nChiyuki immediately volunteers to be Touya's partner, but he shoves her away in disgust, inadvertently learning of her poor health when she starts to spasm. Touya treats Chiyuki more kindly after that, but still refuses to drink her blood.

What's more, not just anyone can go out to hunt monsters; it's heavily influenced by one's role anointed by God. There are eight such eligible roles. Warrior. Fighter. Cleric. Magician. Rogue. Merchant. Hunter. Sorcerer. Those blessed with extraordinary power are divided into three types. Royalty. Heroes. Sages.

You see, he inadvertently reaches the Goddess Technical Help Line, and a goddess is dispatched to grant him one wish.\n\nThe lovely young Belldandy informs him that he may have one wish - a wish for virtually anything in the world.

But of course such a wish has unforseen consequences, including the fact that Keiichi lives in a guys-only dorm. When his roommates return to find him with a woman on the premises, he is immediately tossed out on to the street. But the wish also has other unexpected side effects - such as when Keiichi and Belldandy are in peril of being separated, a motorcycle is suddenly repaired so that they can travel together.\n\n(Source: Dark Horse)	https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/283558l.jpg	7.58	7222	2425	1081	Finished	f	1988-08-24 17:00:00-07	2014-04-24 17:00:00-07	308	48	2025-02-27 18:13:50.689942-08	2025-02-27 18:13:50.689942-08

These mutated humans became known as Alters and were responsible for turning the former Yokohama into a chaotic wasteland.\n\nNow, as the former metropolis continues to re-build itself, the Alters have fallen into two camps: those who have joined HOLY, a dogmatic organization that hopes to re-establish order and morality, and those who wish to lord over the comparatively weaker humans. Only Kazuma, a powerful Alter who's really only interested in looking out for himself and an orphan girl named Kanami, stands between them, suspicious of both sides and unaware that he may hold the key to harmonious co-existence.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)	https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/1/56325l.jpg	6.75	840	12882	9006	Finished	f	2001-05-30 17:00:00-07	2002-04-17 17:00:00-07	45	5	2025-02-27 18:13:55.503313-08	2025-02-27 18:13:55.503313-08

In a single day, he took out the school's top thug and became the new guardian. Now, the entire school is at his mercy, and anyone who dares to challenge him better be ready to meet their maker... or so the stories go.\n\nThe truth is that all of the terrible rumors surrounding Seiichirou are misunderstandings, many assuming the worst about him because of his demon-like features.

However, a splash of crimson blood dyes her world in a red hue, awakening her power—the Arcana of Time. This ability allows her to see the past—her own, which she has locked away, and that of others—and the future.\n\nBut changing the future comes at a price, and to save one life means something else must be sacrificed in return. Amidst the rising tension on the continent, Nakaba must use her power to fight not only for peace, but also to save those she has grown to love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: Chapter count includes extras.	https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/272101l.jpg	7.95	17375	876	408	Finished	f	2009-01-23 16:00:00-08	2013-06-23 17:00:00-07	65	13	2025-03-09 17:18:38.995935-07	2025-03-09 17:18:38.995935-07

Threatened by the soulless killing machines, the Republic of San Magnolia, home to the silver-haired Alba race, evacuated its citizens inside 85 districts and developed supposedly unmanned drones known as Juggernauts to counter the Legion. Even after years of war, the Republic boasts that they have suffered zero casualties. However, the battlefield bathed in crimson recites a different melody.\n\nThe hand dealt to the Colorata people—a minority forced into living in the "nonexistent" 86th district—is one of utter contempt and scorn. Looked upon as human filth, they are ordered to pilot the Juggernauts as Processors under the command of Republican Handlers.\n\nVladilena Milizé, a republican soldier with a strong sense of justice, detests the way her countrymen treat the 86. When she is assigned to the Spearhead Squadron as their handler, she meets a group of oddballs and eventually grows attached to them—particularly their captain, Shinei Nouzen, a boy with a pure sense of purpose and resolve. However, the path they walk is one riddled with death, and growing close to an 86 may have just set Vladilena down a path of despair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]	https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/194315l.jpg	8.83	11512	32	412	Publishing	t	2017-02-09 16:00:00-08	\N	\N	\N	2025-03-09 17:18:39.034801-07	2025-03-09 17:18:39.034801-07

703	Trigun	Trigun	トライガン	Much of the damage attributed to "Vash" is caused by the activities of bounty hunters who are after the 60,000,000,000$$ (sixty billion "double dollars") reward on Vash's head for the destruction of a city called July. Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants "love and peace," as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.\n\nAs the series progresses, more is gradually learned about Vash's mysterious history and the history of the human civilization on Gunsmoke, the desert planet the series is set on. The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense. Vash is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who is almost as good a gunfighter as Vash himself, and later is targeted by a band of assassins known as the Gung-Ho Guns for reasons which are mysterious at first.\n\nTrigun evolves into a very serious discussion of the nature of morality, posing questions such as: What is the nature of morality? Can we judge different moral codes? If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code? Can the person find redemption from their wrongs, and if so, how?\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Trigun (pilot)	https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/153055l.jpg	7.72	16396	1666	453	Finished	f	1995-04-21 17:00:00-07	1997-01-21 16:00:00-08	22	3	2025-03-09 17:18:39.540555-07	2025-03-09 17:18:39.540555-07

Unfortunately, as the eccentric girl slowly opens up to him, Kyon realizes she is dead serious. Moreover, a conversation between the two sparks a dangerous idea in Haruhi's mind: since she is bored with the mundanity of the school's clubs, she should just create her own. With this, the SOS Brigade is born, and Kyon is quickly dragged into a life of absurdity.\n\nTaking over the Literary Club's room, Haruhi soon enlists three new members into her organization: the stoic Yuki Nagato, the timid Mikuru Asahina, and the supposedly mysterious transfer student Itsuki Koizumi.

So naturally, in the summer of 2006 when the Nanba brothers witness something strange in the night sky, Hibito declared that he would become an astronaut and travel to the Moon, while Mutta countered with the affirmation that he would go to Mars. That was the promise they made to each other.\n\nNow in 2025, while Hibito is working with NASA and preparing to become the first Japanese to land on the moon, Mutta has been fired from his job in an automotive development company. Having difficulty finding another job, Mutta is given a lifetime opportunity when he receives a letter from JAXA—the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—telling him that he has been accepted to participate in the next astronaut selection. As if fate has given him a chance to fulfill the promise he made all those years ago, Mutta undertakes the difficult challenge of going to space.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]	https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/166256l.jpg	8.75	8653	50	499	Publishing	t	2007-12-05 16:00:00-08	\N	\N	\N	2025-03-09 17:18:40.108955-07	2025-03-09 17:18:40.108955-07

Desperate to keep the creature in one place, the government agrees, and so the students of Class 3-E find themselves faced with an impossible task—assassinate the creature responsible for destroying the moon.\n\nAlthough the fate of the world now rests on their shoulders, the class has more personal issues to deal with. Trapped at the bottom of Kunugigaoka's hierarchical education system, they face harsh discrimination from both teachers and students alike. Defeatism abound, they don't believe themselves capable of success in daily life, let alone against a monster that surpasses the abilities of any human. But as the enigmatic creature—whom they dub Koro-sensei—educates them in both assassination and academia, the children slowly find the courage to rise up and take aim at their target: the greatest teacher the world has ever seen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 21: Tokyo Department Sensou Taikenki (Tokyo Department Store War Chronicles)	https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/243932l.jpg	8.25	78224	365	74	Finished	f	2012-07-01 17:00:00-07	2016-04-24 17:00:00-07	187	21	2025-03-09 16:58:28.126719-07	2025-03-09 17:23:57.564983-07
