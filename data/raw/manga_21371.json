    "synopsis": "\"Kind\" is not typically a word used to describe Mardock City. This fact is evident by how it has treated Rune Balot—a homeless child prostitute. However, one day, she believes that her life has changed when Shell Septinos, a casino manager, takes her in. He gives Balot a safe haven where she can live peacefully—or so she thinks. Shell ends up attempting to murder Balot, leaving her within an inch of her life.\n\nBlacking out, she is rescued by a man named Dr. Easter, who revives her through an operation that gives her superhuman abilities. Not only does she find herself having much sharper senses, she can also control any electrical appliance with ease. Although she loses her voice in the process, the tradeoff more than makes up for it.\n\nNow equipped with these powers, and with the help of Dr. Easter and a little mouse called Œufcoque Penteano, Balot begins the search to exact revenge on the one who tried to take her life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
