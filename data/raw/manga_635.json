Forced to become an earl upon the untimely death of his father, Cain assumes the role of head of the Hargreaves, a noble family with a dark past. With Riff, his faithful manservant, and Mary Weather, his 10-year-old half sister, Cain investigates the mysterious crimes that seem to follow him wherever he goes.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 5: Nichiyoubi no Solomon Grundy",
