    "synopsis": "In Tsutomu Nihei’s nightmare vision of the future, the N5S virus has swept across the earth, turning most of the population into zombie-like drones. Zoichi Kanoe, an agent of Toa Heavy Industry, is humanity’s last hope, and he’s not even human! With the help of Fuyu, a digitized intelligence built into the computer system of his Heavy Dual Coil motorcycle, Zoichi’s search for the key to salvation will take him on a journey across surreal landscapes and hurl him into a battle against mind-bending evil.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
