    "synopsis": "Tsukino Hiiragi was born deaf. When she transfers to a new school, she meets a talkative boy named Taiyou Enomoto. Tsukino is slightly taken aback by Taiyou, who talks to her without regard to the fact that she can't hear. However, by reading the shape of his mouth carefully, she can notice that he's actually saying nothing but nonsense...? A heartwarming love comedy about a person who talks too much.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
