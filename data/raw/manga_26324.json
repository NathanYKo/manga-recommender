    "synopsis": "After dropping out of middle school following the spread of rumors that shattered his reputation and confidence, 16-year-old Nakaba Endou has become a NEET. He spends his days wallowing in his bedroom until his mother pulls some strings to get him a job at his uncle's convenience store. Wanting to reclaim his life, Nakaba accepts the position as a part-timer, but he soon finds that the job is more difficult than he initially believed.\n\nIn particular, one of his coworkers—Kouhei Yamai—is unreasonably mean and critical toward him. Despite his brutish demeanor, Yamai unknowingly reveals a soft spot to Nakaba when he rescues a stray cat from being run over. Though he is hesitant to get closer to his coworker, Nakaba cannot help but fall for him. Just as Yamai begins to warm up to him, Nakaba's past resurfaces, threatening their delicate relationship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot: Shounen Scrub (Youthful Love)",
