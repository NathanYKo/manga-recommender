    "synopsis": "Heartbroken, 37-year-old music teacher Manabu Hara tries to move on from Rihito Sajou, who is now far away and happy with someone else. As a product of his loneliness during a night out, Hara impulsively kisses an attractive man wearing glasses while imagining Sajou in his stead.\n\nTo Hara's horror, the man turns out to be Aoto Sorano—one of his new students. Despite Sorano promising not to reveal his secret, Hara refuses any advances, as he does not want to become romantically involved with someone underage. However, with his lively and bright appearance, Sorano might be just the person Hara needs in order to love again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
