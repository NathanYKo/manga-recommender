    "synopsis": "Yuuta Togashi is a high school freshman who chose a new school far away from his middle school, due to his mortifying past there. Yuuta was what people would classify as a chuunibyou—a \"disease\" that causes people to fantasize about themselves and their surroundings—with him using the alias of  \"Dark Flame Master.\" He enters high school looking to start anew or, at least, that is what he hoped for.\n\nEverything had been going smoothly, and Yuuta was relishing the feeling of a normal high school life until he met Rikka Takanashi—who despite being a high schooler, is still a chuunibyou—subsequently crumbling Yuuta's short-lived regular high school experience. It would seem that his chuunibyou past is not leaving him just yet.\n\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! follows Yuuta and Rikka's relationship as they experience an eccentric high school journey, with chuunibyou constantly haunting Yuuta.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
