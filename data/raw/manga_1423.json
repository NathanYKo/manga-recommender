    "synopsis": "Volume 1\nTony is a rough-and-tumble jack-of-all-trades with a haunted past. His encounter with Gilver, a mysterious swordsman swathed in bandages, changes his life dramatically for the worse. Tony is thrust into the dark underworld of an unsolvable case, separated from his partner and his loved ones, and pushed over the edge of desperation. Who's forcing him into a corner? What do they hope to achieve? \n\nVolume 2\nDante the giant sword, two-gun toting devil hunter has earned the nickname \"Devil May Cry\" after mercilessly killing any and every undead creature in his path. Now, he is on a mission for an evil idol known as The Beast Head. But little does Dante know that this mission brings him closer to his eternal enemy.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
