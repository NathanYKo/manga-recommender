    "synopsis": "Tasuku is in love with his \"cool and mysterious\" neighbor, Shia. She's three years older than him, a big film buff, and doesn't like him back. The two get together to watch movies every Wednesday, but no matter how many times Tasuku attempts to use these meetups to profess his love for her, Shia sends him right back into the friend zone. Can Tasuku prove himself a mature and capable boyfriend? And what secrets is Shia hiding behind her smiley demeanor?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
