    "synopsis": "Link is a countryside boy who prefers taking care of a newborn chick named Piyoko to sword-fighting lessons with his grandfather. However, fate goes against his desires, for through his bloodline runs the legacy of many great knights who served the land of Hyrule. In addition, his left hand bears the mark of the sacred Triforce—a symbol of his destiny to protect the kingdom. With Piyoko in tow, Link leaves his grandparents' home one autumn morning and heads to the annual knights' trial at Hyrule Castle.\n\nAlthough his path has been predetermined, Link gets sidetracked inside the castle and encounters the Triforce artifact, which whisks him to the fields just outside the village of Holodrum. There, he meets Din, a beautiful dancer who is part of a traveling troupe. Beyond being a performer, Din holds another role that is far more important to Link's fate: the mythical Oracle of Seasons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
