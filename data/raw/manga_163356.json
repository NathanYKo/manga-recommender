    "synopsis": "Today, we live in an age of diversity. The phrase \"non-humans\" is a thing of the past. \"Genjin\" live their lives interacting with human beings.\n\nOne human boy, Yutaka Shinsou, is troubled. He is so used to being in tune with his surroundings that he no longer understands his own feelings. At Keiki High School, where many \"Genjin\" attend, he meets Tsumiki Ogami, a werewolf. She is cute, powerful, a little out of the ordinary, and kind.\n\nWhen he spends time with her, Yutaka's heart is somehow noisier than usual. Spinning an \"unusual\" everyday life with Tsumiki the werewolf, the new normal graph of youth is about to begin.\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
