    "synopsis": "Nishioka is a reckless up-and-coming photographer who prides himself on his independence. Matsukawa is a very rich and successful supervisor at a major advertising company and the object of every woman’s desire. In fact, Matsukawa seems to get along with just about everyone except Nishioka – yet every time the two team up for a modeling contract, their project is a smash hit. On the surface, Matsukawa and Nishioka butt heads at every turn. So why does Nishioka secretly take pictures of Matsukawa when he thinks no one is looking?\n\n(Source: Digital Manga Publishing)",
