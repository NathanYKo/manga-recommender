    "synopsis": "Unlike most villainesses, Melissa Foddebrat is not destined for the gallows or a life of misery. She is a beautiful but sharp-tongued young woman whose childish attitude is merely an annoyance to those around her. However, for a modern Korean woman who has been reincarnated in Melissa's body, none of that matters. She is inside the world of a novel she once read, reliving the life of a wealthy duke's daughter.\n\nMelissa rejects the idea of continuing down the path of villainy. Instead, she strives toward a life of leisure, and to achieve this, she must first end her engagement with the womanizing and simple-minded crown prince. But severing her ties to an undesirable future is more challenging than expected, as the prince proves to be a stubborn opponent. Melissa must rely on her resilience from her former life to shake off the troubles of her new one and instead pursue what—and who—she truly wants.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
