    "synopsis": "On a train ride home one night, corporate slave Kazuaki Sakurai has an unpleasant encounter with another passenger, ruining Sakurai's outfit and documents from work. When the apathetic passenger—Youichi Minagawa—invites him to his residence to make amends for the incident, Sakurai goes without protest.\n\nAside from being a college student, Youichi turns out to own a huge house, which is something unusual for his age. While it piques Sakurai's interest, their unexpected connection does not last long after the compromise was made, and Sakurai returns to his recurring dull life. However, fate seems to have other plans for Sakurai.\n\nDespite not intending to return, he often finds himself back in Youichi's house, and the occurrences that follow draw them closer to each other. In turn, Sakurai starts to take a deeper interest in the young man, while Youichi begins to display a rare side of himself ever since the office worker's appearance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
