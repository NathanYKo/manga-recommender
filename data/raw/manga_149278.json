After her mother's pitiful death, Daphne knows that a similar fate awaits her⁠—but what did she ever do to deserve it? Why does she have to be branded as a wicked child when she's done no wrong? In order to survive, Daphne will have to take her life into her own hands... but will she be able to make a name for herself, or will she be known as the villainess's daughter forever?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
