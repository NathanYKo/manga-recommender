    "synopsis": "Ever since his mother passed away, college student Hinata has been under the care of good-looking Midori, whom Hinata has known for years. Strict but warmhearted, Midori always tries to protect Hinata from danger. Although Hinata finds his caretaker to be slightly overbearing, he worries that Midori may one day disappear from his sight and leave him alone—just like his family did.\n\nWhen Hinata begins to notice anomalies involving Midori, he suspects him to be a ghost and decides to help the mysterious man pass on. While searching for him, Hinata spots a giant three-legged crow washing in a tub—who turns out to be none other than Midori himself!\n\nIn reality, Midori is a god who has his own reasons for staying with Hinata but wishes not to tell him. Feeling betrayed by his guardian, Hinata begins to doubt Midori’s intentions and the truth about their relationship; however, unbeknownst to him, their time together might end sooner than expected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
