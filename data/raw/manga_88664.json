    "synopsis": "Mysterious orbs from space shower over the evening skies of Japan, with one of them effortlessly entering the body of 17-year-old Minoru Utsugi. Unfortunately, when the magical orb reads Minoru's deep desire to fade into obscurity, it misinterprets his intent. Instead of solitude, the strange sphere bestows upon him a sharper sense of hearing, incredible running speed, and—most surprisingly—a seemingly indestructible invisible shield that envelops his whole body.\n\nMinoru's enhanced abilities are useful for distancing himself from others. However, his powers also draw unwanted attention from his classmates, a top-secret organization, and superhuman criminals known as Ruby Eyes. When a sinister individual starts targeting people close to him, Minoru must decide between his ordinary life and protecting his friends. Regardless of the choice Minoru makes, he is determined to fulfill his desire for absolute isolation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
