    "synopsis": "At Nakajima's high school, there is a rather frightening girl named Tanaka. Having heard rumors about her killing people with a simple glance, Nakajima hopes to avoid becoming her desk neighbor. Unfortunately for him, though, that is exactly what happens!\n\nNot wanting to form any preconceptions about Tanaka, Nakajima attempts to be friendly with his classmate. However, every time he looks at her, he is always met with a glare! Nonetheless, as he spends more time with her, Nakajima is slowly exposed to Tanaka's endearing side—realizing that she might not be so scary after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
