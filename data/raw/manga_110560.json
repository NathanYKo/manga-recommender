    "synopsis": "Ruby is a student at an elite European boarding school. Things are going pretty well for her until she finds out that she won't be able to go home for Christmas. Instead, she'll be stuck at school with only one other student—the aloof and beautiful Steph—for company. As Ruby tries to understand Steph, she becomes more and more attracted to her. But can she break through Steph's icy exterior?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
