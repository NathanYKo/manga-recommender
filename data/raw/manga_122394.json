    "synopsis": "Yamaguchi is a smart, rather popular boy who sits next to Satou-san, who just can't seem to do anything right. She doesn't do well in school, is awkward, and freezes up whenever the attention is on her. But she's always optimistic and caring, and seems to face every challenge with a smile, even if she ends up failing at most of them. As they slowly get to know each other, Yamaguchi's initial feeling of discomfort starts to change...\n\n(Source: MU)",
