Sumire's mother tells her that it's a town where she'll fall in love, and it she meets her first love in a very unexpected way: the good-looking Kaduki Miyamoto, as he tries to escape from his home. Through an unfortunate set of events, the wheels of fate have begun to turn for Sumire, as Kaduki is more than he appears to be. In fact, he's a traditional dancer! Will Sumire's first love be a happy one? Or does a bumpy road await her?\n\n(Source: From Awakened Memories and StarryHeaven)",
