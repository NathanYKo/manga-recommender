    "synopsis": "After playing the game \"Dungeon and Stone\" for nine years, Hansoo Lee finally reached the boss stage which had never been cleared by anyone before. However, upon entering the boss room, he received a notification that he had completed the tutorial and was now inhabiting the body of a playable character named Bjorn Jandel, who was a barbarian.\n\nIn the world of \"Dungeon and Stone,\" only one city remained standing following the world's destruction. Every month, a labyrinth would appear, offering explorers a chance to clear it and earn rewards. Barbarians were viewed as useless in all but combat, and those who didn't fight were unable to survive. If someone couldn't pay the exorbitant taxes imposed by the city, they faced the death penalty for tax evasion.\n\nIf it's discovered that a player possesses the character they're playing, they're labelled an \"evil spirit\" and killed. The only way for Hansoo to survive is to venture into the labyrinth and risk his life in battle. Armed with his accumulated skills from nine years of gameplay and a stupidly strong barbarian physique, he strives to survive in this game.\n\n(Source: Naver Corporation, translated)",
