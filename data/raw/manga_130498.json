    "synopsis": "Deep within the forest, a cozy and rather cluttered cottage sits on the lakeshore, housing a mysterious, feared witch. In truth, she is a lovely young woman named Rose, who has learned the art of potion-making from her wise grandmother. Rose cherishes her tucked-away life, yet there is a longing in her heart—for a handsome knight she once saw, Sir Harij Azm.\n\nFor four years, Rose's feelings for Harij have lingered, but she can never act on them; witches live outside of human affairs and belong to no country or man. So, when Harij suddenly appears on her doorstep looking for a love potion, Rose is both surprised and heartbroken. Although another woman has captured the noble knight's heart, Rose decides to help him. But before crafting the potion, Rose sends Harij on a series of ridiculous quests for each ingredient, hoping to delay the inevitable and savor their fleeting time together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
