    "synopsis": "One day, Charlotte Bennett comes to study abroad in Akihito Aoyagi's class.\n\nAll of his classmates are attracted to Charlotte's innocent, elegant behavior and cute appearance, but Akihito calmly feels that she lives in a different world and takes a step back. However, when he helps Charlotte's younger sister, Emma, who was lost, Akihito's daily life changes drastically. After finding out that the Bennett sisters live in the next room of the apartment building, and also that Emma has grown fond of Akihito, the Bennett sisters come to visit his room every day. The three of them play dominoes, sit around the dinner table, and go out together. As they spend time together, Akihito and Charlotte grow closer, despite their clumsiness―a sweet and enticing love comedy next door begins!\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
