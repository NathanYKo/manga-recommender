    "synopsis": "A gray and sullen sky, the muddy ground squelching beneath her feet, and a faint drizzle of rain soaking her to the bone—after every regression, Karen Heyer recovers her memories of the past at this moment. While she has lived her life over and over, an untimely death is the only ending she can achieve. On her first iteration, she merely thought she had awakened in a novel, compelling her to follow the story to reach her happy end. But happiness is not written in her fate.\n\nNo matter what she does, whom she meets, or what she says, a brutal death awaits. On the 100th iteration, however, Karen decides to try something new—murder. Ninety-nine deaths would drive any normal person mad, and Karen has never considered herself anything but ordinary. Perhaps trying to stir the pot will help her reach a different ending entirely.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
