    "synopsis": "Aiden was a normal, albeit glitched, NPC trying to make ends meet to support his sister when suddenly, the all-powerful system administrator appeared and deleted his whole town during routine maintenance. Due to his particular glitch, Aiden instead gains the power of an administrator... but it's too little too late, as his sister slowly fades into nothing in his arms. With his new administrator update abilities, Aiden swears to get revenge on the unseen overlords of his world. He'll stop NPC's from ever being deleted again!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
