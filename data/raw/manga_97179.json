    "synopsis": "Seventeen-year-old Kei Miyama comes from a family with strange abilities. Birds flock to his grandfather as if he is the wind that carries them in the air itself. Kei, on the other hand, can talk to cars and prefers their company to humans—especially women. After moving to Iceland, Kei makes a living there as a freelance detective.\n\nWhether it be resolving lovers' quarrels, locating missing people, or recovering lost items, Kei hops from case to case, traveling alone on the empty roads that span the rugged Icelandic landscape. But the secrets of the land of ice and fire are not the only mysteries ahead that Kei must unravel: an encounter with an aloof Icelandic beauty makes him recall local superstitions of ghosts that roam the wild lands at night.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
