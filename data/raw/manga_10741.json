    "synopsis": "Harumi has been in the hospital practically her whole life. She has a life-threatening disease, and is kept inside at all times. Her life is incredibly mundane until she meets Masato, a new patient. He isn’t the best influence, being a heavy smoker and drinker, but since they’ve both got nothing better to do, they become friends. This humorous oneshot follows their meeting and the night they spend together, talking about what it means to die early.\n\n(Source: Nagareboshi Manga)",
