    "synopsis": "Rina despises perverted guys. She can't seem to find the prince she so desperately seeks, that's before she meets the new transfer student, Jin Ookami. Behind his hair, she discovers the face of her prince. The truth is, he was raised by a wolf, and his seemingly perverted actions for the most part are innocent instincts. How will Rina deal with the new object of her affection, when said person is a true wolf? Is this the beginning of true love?\n\n(Source: Boku wa Ookami Wikia)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Koibito Shoumeisho",
