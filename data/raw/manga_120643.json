    "synopsis": "Born into a family of notorious womanizers, Akemitsu Akagami has been shunned from a young age and lumped in with his lineage as a skirt-chaser. As a result, he despises the Akagami way of life and vows to rescind the infamy of his family by staying celibate. But as fate would have it, Akemitsu falls in love at first sight on his way home from work one day. Unable to erase his feelings that are spiraling out of control, he resorts to his final measure—to practice as a monk and seal away his worldly desires.\n\nHoping to put his past behind him, Akemitsu travels to the nearest temple in order to receive Buddhist training. But fate tempts him once again: greeting him at the door is the girl he had fallen madly in love with, who lives in the very temple he wishes to train in.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
