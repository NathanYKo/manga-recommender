    "synopsis": "All members of the Ascania imperial family are cursed to die at the hands of a loved one, a curse only broken by the birth of a girl into the bloodline. So when a young slave girl with the telltale, color-changing Ascania eyes is discovered, she's declared Princess Chloe, the little sister of the three princes. She's excited to finally have a family, but her new brothers seem a bit strange... They've always had to be cold and unfeeling for their own protection, but will Chloe's arrival plant the seed of change in their hearts?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
