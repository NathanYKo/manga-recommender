    "synopsis": "In one unusual Tokyo high school, education takes a backseat to brawling as warring clubs wreak havoc in the hallways and chaos in the classrooms, all vying to be the baddest team around! Although they often contribute their fair share, only a handful of students serve to stem the tide of violence in this untamed outpost. These are the few, the proud, the powerful: the members of the Juken Club!\n\n(Source: CMX)",
    "background": "The first 18 volumes of Tenjou Tenge were published in English as Tenjho Tenge by DC Comics under the CMX imprint from March 1, 2005, to September 8, 2009, before the publisher went defunct. The CMX release came under heavy criticism from fans for editing and censoring the sexual content. VIZ Media republished the series uncut as Tenjo Tenge: Full Contact Edition under the VIZ Signature imprint as 2-in-1 omnibus volumes from June 21, 2011, to February 5, 2013. It was also published in Italian by Panini Comics from September 2001 to August 25, 2011; and in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora JBC from January 2009 to July 2011.",
