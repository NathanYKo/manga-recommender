    "synopsis": "Sora hasn't been having a great weekend. Not only did he lose his job, but now his girlfriend's left him as well. Weighed down by misery and disappointment, he stumbles upon a stranger in the park. With a stunning meteor shower above and a friendly ear to his side, the young college student is offered a brief respite from his problems. But when the stranger leans in for a kiss, Sora is left dumbstruck. Was this chance encounter just a new problem to add to the list or have the stars finally aligned in his favor?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
