    "synopsis": "Wakaba is cocky, condescending, foul-mouthed, and absolutely in love with her childhood friend, Daiki. For as long as they've known each other, Wakaba's been the very image of a roughhousing tomboy, but all that's about to change. When she shows up in front of him, wearing a cutesy, feminine outfit, will she get the hopeless late bloomer's heart racing? When you can't put your feelings into words, an image change might just be the right gambit!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
