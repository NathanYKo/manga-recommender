She dreams of becoming a member of AKB48, but stage fright gets in the way of every audition. Having failed so many times, Yoshinaga decides to tryout one last time before giving up for good.\n\nThough uninterested in idols, Minoru Urayama wants to help Yoshinaga realize her dream. Disguising himself as a girl named \"Urakawa Minori,\" he participates in the audition for AKB48 as well, hoping to assist Yoshinaga through the tryouts. However, things go better than expected when both Yoshinaga and \"Minori\" are recruited! As he enters the world of pop music, Minoru must continue to hide his secret all while supporting Yoshinaga's dreams and finding one of his own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
