    "synopsis": "Shima really adores her parents, the loud-spoken alpha Akane Kuroga and the collected omega Aoi Shirosaki. However, despite the loving relationship these men have today, they were once just brash students who were bound to butt heads due to the rivalry between their schools. The two should have hated each other immediately, but instead, they felt an instant connection. From prospective rivals to lovers, the men tell their daughter the story of how they met, fell in love, and had her—creating a warm and tender family of their own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
