    "synopsis": "A Campione—a Godslayer—is a supreme ruler.\n\nSince he can kill a celestial being, he can therefore call on the sacrosanct, divine powers wielded by the gods.\n\nA Campione—a Godslayer—is a lord.\n\nSince the power to kill a deity is in his hands, he therefore looms over all mortals on Earth.\n\nA Campione—a Godslayer—is a devil.\n\nFor all mortals who live in the world, none can hope to match their power.\n\nKusanagi Godou, a 16-year-old boy who played in the senior league as catcher and fourth hitter when he was in junior high school. However, an injury put an end to his future in baseball.\n\nDuring the spring break of his third and last year, he got involved in an adventure and ended up slaying one of the Heretic Gods, Verethragna. Thus, he became the youngest and seventh—Campione.\n\nNow that he is a Campione, a godslayer, the young Godou must defeat the troublemaking gods, with the help of his followers!\n\n(Source: MU)",
