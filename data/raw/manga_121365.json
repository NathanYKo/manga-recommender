Except this girl gets rescued in the nick of time. And the man who finds her? He's her new boss, Alchemist Kurakazu Rintarou. Chloe has a knack for cleaning and thus becomes his housekeeper. But she quickly reveals another hidden talent of hers—necromancy! Watch as this story of science and fiction unfold under one roof.\n\n(Source: Comikey Media)",
