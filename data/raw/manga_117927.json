    "synopsis": "Murakumo Inn is different from other hotels—its location is unknown, and it accepts both human and non-human patrons. The owner, no less mysterious, does not ask his guests to pay money for their stay; instead, they must tell him one of their most hideous secrets. Otherwise, he shall intervene and create a secret for them to hide.\n\nTokihito Sasaki considered himself an ordinary high school student until he met the owner and discovered he had long been dead. Yet, with the help of the innkeeper, he can now live among humans at the cost of being a living corpse. Despite being given a second chance, Sasaki resents the owner for turning him into a monster. In hopes of exacting revenge, he teams up with a sorcerer whose family has spent centuries trying to banish the inn's proprietor.\n\nHowever, the inn is guarded by its employees, and the owner himself is not a helpless spirit. Only those who find his secret can take him out—if they survive to do so.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
