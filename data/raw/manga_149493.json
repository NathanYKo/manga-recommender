    "synopsis": "Hwang Yura has always dreamed of becoming a star. Unfortunately, luck does not seem to be on her side, as she has yet to land a major role despite making her debut seven years ago. Still, Yura continues to put her best foot forward and receives a role in a movie destined for success. Much to her dismay, she is once again cast in a minor role.\n\nOnce on set, Yura runs into two familiar faces—her narcissistic ex-boyfriend Kim Jeong-u and famous actor Kang Seunghyeon. While Yura promises herself to keep her head in the game despite Jeong-u's egotistical presence, the handsome Seunghyeon takes an interest in her due to the circumstances of their previous encounters. Through the strenuous filming, the unknown actress and the lead star form a unique relationship. All the while, Yura tackles the relentless challenges of the entertainment industry on her journey to stardom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
