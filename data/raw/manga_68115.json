    "synopsis": "For the past six years, Aki and a certain boy have barely exchanged any words. As they pass each other to head to their respective schools every day, their communication has consisted mainly of the nostril-flaring, eye-bulging, and mouth-contorting looks that they exchange. One morning however, this daily ritual is broken when the boy does not respond with a funny face of his own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
