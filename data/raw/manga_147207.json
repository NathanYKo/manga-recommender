    "synopsis": "As Aria Roscente walks to the gallows, the people cheer, elated to see the death of a true villainess. Her tale is a rags-to-riches story; after her mother married a count, Aria began flaunting her newfound wealth and abusing her status. The people could only pity her saint-like sister, Mielle, who had to put up with such a sibling for many years. But right before she dies, Aria learns the truth—her downfall was all part of Mielle's plan.\n\nWhen Aria reawakens, she finds she is in the past, and beside her is a mysterious hourglass. The former villainess now has only one goal: revenge. From the count's respect to her fiance's affection, everything that Mielle once loved will be Aria's. Using her knowledge of the future and the hourglass' power to turn back time, Aria will do whatever it takes, even if that means using others or faking a smile, to see her vengeance through.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
