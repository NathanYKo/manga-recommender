    "synopsis": "The \"Generation of Miracles\" is a name given to a team of five middle school basketball prodigies who led Teikou Middle School to win three consecutive championship titles. Underneath all of the prestige, they are middle school students with middle school problems at the end of the day. From managing their crushes to planning the perfect summer vacation, these prodigies find themselves in typical age-appropriate situations in the company of amusing friends and teammates.\n\nAdapted from the light novels of the same series, Kuroko no Basuke: Replace Plus follows the antics of Tetsuya Kuroko and the Generation of Miracles before they went their separate ways. Intermixed with the hilarity are anecdotes from their high school teammates, who also end up in strangely hilarious situations outside the court.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
