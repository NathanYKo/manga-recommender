    "synopsis": "Agricultural student Shizuko Ayanokouji was enjoying a normal day of high-school life, until a lone raindrop fell in front of her. Suddenly, Shizuko lost consciousness and woke up in the middle of the woods, but it wasn't like she teleported - she was in a different era all together. She was in the Sengoku period in Japan. Her peace didn't last forever though, for she was attacked by bandits. Much to her surprise, she was saved last minute by Nobunaga Oda himself! After Shizuko stated that she studied the latest agriculture, Nobunaga decided to let her serve him as a village chief of a small rural town. What will happen when people discover that she's from the future? Will Shizuko be able to please Nobunaga and keep up with his demands?",
