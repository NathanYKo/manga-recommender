    "synopsis": "Eight years ago, Shion Ishiwatari's parents were brutally murdered in front of her, the shock of the incident rendering her mute. The events having become a distant memory, she now lives a peaceful life as Shion Yasuoka, the adopted daughter of the Yasuoka family. Influenced by the past, both known and unknown to her, she begins cultivating her interest in shogi, eventually deciding to pursue a career in the strategy game as a kishi—a professional shogi player. Shion dreams of one day becoming the meijin—the most exalted shogi master in all of Japan.\n\nThe gears of time, however, are set in motion once again when a stalker threatens her future aspirations. Silent yet determined, Shion presses forward on her journey to become a meijin. As she continues to hone her craft, the mysteries of her past slowly unravel, and the truths hidden on the board as well as in her own life begin to reveal themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
