    "synopsis": "As a member of the art club, Shintaro Ibuki is stuck with the arduous task of making a piece of school equipment by hand. While crafting, he notices the intimidating Kyoko Sugisaki glaring at him. Unsatisfied with his clumsy efforts, Kyoko eventually steps in and quickly finishes his work for him. Wishing to return the favor, Shintaro helps with the sketch Kyoko was working on.\n\nFascinated by each other's different areas of expertise—Shintaro by Kyoko's special talent for handcrafting drums and Kyoko by Shintaro's impressive art skills—they begin working together on various projects. But their shared passion for creating beautiful things may be just the first step for romantic feelings to appear in full bloom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
