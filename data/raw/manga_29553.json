    "synopsis": "Forty-five years ago, people with superpowers suddenly started appearing in the city of Stern Bild as a result of an unknown mutation. These powerful individuals were given the name \"NEXT.\" Though some used their powers for evil, others chose to rise up to protect the city and become heroes. However, in Stern Bild, heroes do more than just fight crime—they use their abilities to promote sponsors and compete against each other to rack up points on the hit show HERO TV!\n\nFalling behind in the rankings this season is veteran hero Kotetsu T. Kaburagi, also known as \"Wild Tiger.\" As a result of Tiger's incompetence, his sponsor is bought out by Apollon Media and he ends up having to combine forces with the cocky, amateur hero Barnaby \"Bunny\" Brooks Jr. Despite their potential to be a great crime-fighting duo, they could not be more different. While Tiger prefers to act on instinct and charge in, Bunny uses his wits to analyze the situation—causing them to often clash. Nevertheless, if they wish to become the top heroes, they will have to put aside their differences and work together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
