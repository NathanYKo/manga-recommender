    "synopsis": "Dreaming of someday owning his own shop, traveling merchant Kraft Lawrence spends his days looking for trade opportunities. One day, however, Lawrence's adventure takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a naked wolf girl asleep in his wagon.\n\nThe charming girl claims to be Holo, the wolf deity of the nearby town Pasloe. Having grown weary of the ungrateful locals, she requests Lawrence to take her back to her hometown of Yoitsu, located farther north. In return, she will help him with his mercantile affairs, lending him her shrewd mind and keen judgement.\n\nThe pair now travels from town to town, dealing with various people and the troubles they come with. But as their hearts and destination grow closer, their days of companionship are numbered.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
