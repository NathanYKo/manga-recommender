    "synopsis": "Ryou Karuizawa is about to graduate from middle school, however, he has one thing weighing him down—his undeclared love for Miton Omoi. She's good-looking and has a great personality, not to mention her excellent grades. Even though she plans to go to an all-girls high school, he decides to confess anyway. To his massive surprise, Omoi accepts his feelings! In a daze, Karuizawa doesn't know what to expect next. In contrast, Omoi does not wait around. She starts by transferring schools to come to his, planning out their wedding to be held two years from now, and sets absurd rules for their relationship. Immediately, Karuizawa realizes one thing: the intensity of Omoi's feelings is just like her name, absurdly heavy!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
