    "synopsis": "A boy wakes up in a hospital bed, surrounded by a group of strangers. He is told that his name is Tsubasa Ichinose and that these strangers are his various family members. The Ichinose family consists of: Minako, the mother; Kakeru, the father; Sachie, the grandmother; Kozo, the grandfather; Shiori, Tsubasa's little sister; and Tsubasa himself. They all suffered a car accident that left them with amnesia.\n\nWith no one to rehabilitate their memories, the Ichinose family is forced to start over from zero—in more ways than one. Though they decide to get through this ordeal together, they are confronted with the reality of their past selves upon returning to their home. Nevertheless, Tsubasa defiantly believes the family can still come together to support each other, even as it becomes increasingly clear that each member is hiding a secret from the life they cannot remember.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 6: Doujin Seiji, Sanka",
