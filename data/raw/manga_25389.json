    "synopsis": "Despite being completely hopeless at endeavors like farming and cooking, Liselotte, a young lady of noble birth, picks up and moves to a remote land with her twin attendants Alto and Anna. At the easternmost reaches of her new home lies a forest where it's said witches roam. When Lise one day finds herself at the receiving end of an attack by one such witch, she's saved by the sudden appearance of a young man named Engetsu. Though they're strangers, Engetsu is remarkably similar to someone she already knows...?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
