    "synopsis": "All Charlize Ronan ever wanted was to bring honor to her family. But instead, she is forced into becoming a \"living sword\"—a mere tool for the emperors. It is from this hell that she prays for justice... and awakens in her former body. Now, determined to tear down this horrible empire, Charlize seeks out the young prince, Dylan Blade. She will put him on the throne, not as an honorable ruler, but as a tyrant. It is time for Charlize to tame the one who will bring forth her revenge.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
