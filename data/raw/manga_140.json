    "synopsis": "In an age of magic and sorcery, the world is divided between those who have supernatural powers and those who don't. Fighting for justice and against black magic and evildoers everywhere are the Sorcerer Hunters: Gateau, Carrot, Chocolat, Mocha, and the rest of the gang. Their quest is to destroy each of the Platina stones- the objects the evil sorcerers use for creating their black magic - in an entertaining mix of farce and adventure.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
