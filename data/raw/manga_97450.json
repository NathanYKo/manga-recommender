    "synopsis": "Enjoying the tranquility between the bookshelves, Touko Ashina spends her time volunteering as the sole member of her school's library committee. However, her cherished peace is disrupted when she finds someone sleeping among the shelves—a first-year named Yuuto Hayama. As it turns out, Hayama was recently given detention, and his punishment is to assist Ashina. Hayama is known for his irresistible charm, and the rumors of the reason behind his detention are too much for his innocent upperclassman to handle.\n\nAlthough Ashina tries to ignore idle gossip, Hayama's playful teasing and unexpected love for books make her cheeks burn red. She has never felt special or like she could compete with other beautiful girls, but Hayama has a way of making her grow bolder around him. As the two spend more time together, it soon appears that Hayama can no longer see Ashina as just another girl.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
