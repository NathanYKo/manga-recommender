    "synopsis": "Upon entering high school, first-year student Yusa Tachikawa fell in love with a tall, athletic senior on her school's basketball team. Watching the basketball team practice every day with her best friend, Nanami Sugio, Yusa eagerly looks for chances to talk to him.\n\nOne day, Kaede Haruta, a quiet guy from Yusa's class, takes shelter from the rain in Yusa's part-time workplace. Looking to keep him entertained in the meantime, she recommends he read her favorite shoujo manga. The following day, while Yusa is talking to the guy she likes, she realizes that Nanami harbors feelings for him too! Worried that Nanami will restrain her feelings for Yusa's sake, she claims that she loves Haruta instead. With determination to maintain their cover, Yusa asks Haruta to pretend as her boyfriend, and even though he is far from her ideal type, she begins to question what she really thinks of Haruta.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
