Feeling somewhat depressed she and her friends from the club take a trip to the beach and discover Beach volleyball. Iruka cant wait to play and rushes to the court only to be told to give up being a player because of her short stature by the local Volleyball Diva. In a rage Iruka challenges her to a match to prove her abilities. It doest look like she has a chance but Iruka has a secret weapon and nobody will ever make fun of her on the beach again....well....Not about her ability to play Volleyball anyway...\n\n(Source: MU)",
