    "synopsis": "\"Okay, so I've come to another world.\"\n\nBefore he knew it, he was alone in a mountain full of plants and creatures that he'd never seen before. When he goes down the mountain after avoiding encounters with a big slime and bandits, he reaches a castle where he is taken captive as a suspicious person. While being interrogated in the dungeon by the female knight Irias, he talks about the bandits he saw, and Irias, who was at wit's end in the search for said bandits, quickly hunts them down.\n\nHe doesn't want to be a hero, or to build a harem: \"I just want to live safely.\" A story that such a man who survives in another world with \"understanding\" as a weapon!\n\n(Source: Hifumi Shobo, translated)",
