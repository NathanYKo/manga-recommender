    "synopsis": "From an outsider's perspective, what they are seeing is a normal meetup between three girls. However, these \"girls\" are meeting for the first time because of one commonality: they were born as males, but crossdress for various reasons.\n\nRyousuke \"Yui\" Kijima pretends to be his deceased older sister to keep her memory alive, Osamu \"Parou\" Tamura dresses as a girl to attract his straight senior in school, and Yuuta \"Marika\" Aoki is a transgender female. Despite their similarities, Yui hates how the other two are satisfied with their habits, and leaves quickly. Then alone, Parou expresses his support for Marika, causing her to fall in love with him.\n\nThough their meeting was cut short, the lives of these three people begin to cross. As they grapple with their genders and identities, romantic feelings begin to foster, sharpening the divide between them, yet bring them closer at the same time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
