    "synopsis": "After a night of drinking and lamenting over her love life, Hinata is surprised by a knock on her door. But even more surprising is the handsome man on the other side! Except there's one problem: he's her former student from years ago. Shintarou has always loved Hinata and spent years proposing and expressing his love for his sensei even though she was 17 years older. Hinata did her best to spare his feelings and told him she'd only marry him once he was 18 and an adult. Sure enough, that time has come. But can Hinata really get mixed up with one of her former students?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
