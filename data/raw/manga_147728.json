    "synopsis": "So I've become Yunifer Magnolia, the villainess who's crazed with jealousy that Duke Ishid Lucrenze, the devastatingly handsome hero, has eyes only for Raelle, Yunifer's best friend. Yunifer torments Raelle so much that Yunifer's killed off at the end. But... I'M Yunifer now. UGH! Good news is, I've reincarnated a year before her tragic end, so there's time to make sure Ishid and Raelle have a fairy tale ending (and I stay alive). Bad news is, I got drunk and woke up with Ishid next to me. Crap.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
