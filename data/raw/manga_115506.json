    "synopsis": "Throughout elementary school, Sayaka Saeki has prided herself on being the ideal child. By achieving good grades, participating in various extracurricular activities, and demonstrating model etiquette, she thought her life was going exactly as planned. However, after receiving a romantic confession from a girl in her swim class, Sayaka realizes how emotions can defy her logical, straightforward thinking.\n\nWanting to cooperate rather than compete with peers at the start of middle school, Sayaka's shift in perspective leads her to befriend her senior Chie Yuzuki. As the two form a gentle bond, Yuzuki confesses her feelings to Sayaka, who reciprocates her affection in hopes of learning the significance of love. Despite sacrificing her devotion to academics, their relationship ends, leaving Sayaka scarred with resentment.\n\nSwearing to never let her feelings take control of her life again, Sayaka vows to revive her independence in high school. But when class representative Touko Nanami captures her eye, Sayaka must settle her struggle between accepting her genuine self or pursuing her logical way of life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
