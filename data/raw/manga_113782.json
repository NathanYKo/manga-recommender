Meguru Soma is a stylish boy who loves the \"genderless\" fashion subculture and can make himself stand out in any crowd. Though their relationship may appear unconventional, Wako and Meguru's shared obsession with makeup and the latest trends is more than enough to bring them together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
