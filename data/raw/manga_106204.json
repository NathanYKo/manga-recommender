    "synopsis": "In a fantasy world, there exist witches capable of curses nearly impossible to remove except by very few methods: receive a loving kiss from a prince, hope the wrathful witch has a change of heart, or attempt a third possibility.\n\nGuideau and Ashaf are an unusual duo working for the Order of Magical Resonance, an organization that deals with any case related to magic. Guideau, a young woman with the eyes of a beast and a knack for rushing into things head-on, has a deeply personal grudge against witches. Ashaf, a refined yet enigmatic man who carries a coffin on his back, keeps his partner in check with a calm manner and presence of mind. Together, they investigate magical mysteries and crimes, all while looking for the witch who cursed Guideau.\n\nThe pair arrive in a city where they have heard a witch resides; however, much to their surprise, the people of the city consider the witch to be a hero protecting them. Both Guideau and Ashaf believe that only trouble follows a witch wherever she goes—but that remains to be seen here.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Majo no Kimagure (Witch and Whim)",
