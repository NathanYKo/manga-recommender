    "synopsis": "Inuzuka Taroumaru is a first year high school student who looks like a delinquent. One evening, while he's at his part-time job, he ends up with a white-feathered arrow through his head! He's told that this arrow means he has been chosen as the sacrifice for \"Inugami-hime,\" who lives on top of the nearby mountain. However, this mysterious \"Inugami-hime\" turns out to be a cute girl who has chosen him to be her servant, not her sacrifice. Their life together is just beginning!\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
