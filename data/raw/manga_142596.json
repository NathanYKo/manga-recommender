    "synopsis": "To die at the hands of the male lead—that was Carnelia Easter's fate. As the daughter of a penniless baron, she was betrothed as a child to Cesear, the first prince, as part of the empress' plot to give him the least political power possible. Carnelia was not only her spy but also a greedy woman with no redeeming qualities. Her shortcomings ultimately led to her demise—a fitting ending for the supporting antagonist.\n\nWhen a woman dies in a traffic accident, she is reincarnated as Carnelia mere hours after her and Cesear's wedding. To avoid being killed, she plans to befriend her husband and then depart peacefully when the time comes for him to meet the main female character. However, unbeknownst to her, Cesear has gotten attached to Carnelia and might not let her go so easily.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
