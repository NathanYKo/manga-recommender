    "synopsis": "High schooler Hajime Tsukiyoda went to Shibuya that day hoping only to find inspiration for his next film. he never expected to find himself smack-dab in the middle of a real-life horror movie. Without warning, schools of massive goldfish descend upon the crowded streets, and the mystified onlookers' confusion quickly turns to terror as the fish begin to feed. From their tentative shelter, Hajime and a handful of survivors await a rescue that seems more and more unlikely as the days and hours tick by. meanwhile, all around them, the bloody feeding frenzy rages...\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
