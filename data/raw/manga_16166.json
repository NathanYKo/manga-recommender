    "synopsis": "Bi-Kwang is a handsome young warrior who becomes a drooling mess whenever he sees a pretty girl. Out on the road he meets an extraordinary swordfighter with no name who is searching for a legendary master warrior. Bi-Kwang promises to aid the swordfighter if he lets Bi-Kwang meet his beautiful sister. Of course, it turns out the swordfighter is the sister, Hwa-Rin Dahm, and she must switch identities to keep the plot moving along. Bi-Kwang is immediately smitten, and thus we have a triangle involving only two people.\n\nThe story takes place in a setting in each side is trying to unify the Murim as a whole, and while this is taking place, Bi-Kwang who is extremely good at learning martial arts but doesn't want to learn it, gets into a deal where he takes the girl to see her grand father since he was the last person to see him before he disappeared and on the way he encounters many enemies and some friends (who show up from time to time) and he matures since he realizes why martial arts is so important and that he has been using it wrongly.",
