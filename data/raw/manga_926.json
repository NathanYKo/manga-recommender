    "synopsis": "High school student Yukari Fujimaru knows a potential star when she sees one…because she sees the special \"aura\" they give off, in the form of angelic wings. Yukari's fellow student, the beautiful Ryouko Katsuragi, has a small pair of wings herself, and is one of these aspiring talents. She's so talented, in fact, that no one even knows that \"she\" is actually a boy in disguise. Now, to make her own down-to-earth dream come true, Yukari must help her new friend become a star.\n\n(Source: CMX)",
