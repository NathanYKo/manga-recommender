    "synopsis": "The virtual reality game \"History of the Archana Continent\" became part of reality, and \"players\" who were synchronized with humans appeared to protect the world. Hoyeol Lee, who was an ordinary salaryman, took over the body of the character he created in middle school, \"Grandfell Claudi Arpeus Romeo.\" Under normal circumstances, it would have been an absolute failure of a career, but Grandfell, whose occupation is a \"demon hunter,\" becomes extremely proud in front of demons! The only demon hunter in this world, Grandfell (= Hoyeol) starts to make a move!\n\n(Source: Naver Corporation, translated)",
