    "synopsis": "Mankind discovered the essence of the human soul, Edeya, and were achieving materialization. Society was built around Edeya, which was invulnerable to conventional weapons. Humanity started to place all their focus into the combat power of Edeya. Jinsong Park, the main character, possessed an F-rank soul and F-rank combat power. After the introduction of a poor military program to his high school and the Edeya rank system, Park Jinsong became one of the weak, and suffered under his peers' contempt for 10 years...\n\nHowever, in reality, the Edeya he had awakened was actually the S-rank \"Absolute Killing Intent.\" Jinsong was greatly disturbed by the fact that the essence of his soul revolved around the thought of killing others, and continued to live his life while thinking of himself as a worthless F-rank. Will Jinsong, with a soul for killing, be able to get his killing intent under control and prove that there are no ranks to one's soul?\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",
