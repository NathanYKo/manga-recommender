    "synopsis": "While in middle school, Haruna Nagashima threw herself into playing softball while secretly dreaming of finding romance, but without any luck. High school has just started for her, and she now has the perfect chance to fall in love with a potential boyfriend. But there's one problem—she has no idea where to begin!\n\nOn her first day of school, she accidentally bumps into You Komiyama, the most popular boy in the year. With his stunning looks, Haruna is positive he can help. The handsome boy reluctantly agrees to coach her about love under one condition: she must not fall in love with him. Under You's guidance, will Haruna be able to kick off her high school debut and find herself a boyfriend?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
