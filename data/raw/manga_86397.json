    "synopsis": "Nothing captivates Miho Sakurai more than watching the boys' volleyball club practice as she draws them spiking the ball over the net. Though she spends a lot of time sketching her senior Hayato, Sakurai has recently taken more of an interest in Takei, a short boy on the team.\n\nAs the team prepares for an upcoming tournament, Sakurai finds herself worrying about Takei, who has grown more insecure about his height since being added to the starting lineup. To complicate matters further, Hayato suddenly confesses his love for Sakurai—prompting her to finally face her own feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
