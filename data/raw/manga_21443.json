    "synopsis": "Meet the Sun Knight, the dashing leader of the Twelve Holy Knights. With his enchanting blue eyes, shining golden hair and dazzling smile he's the epitome of perfection—the perfect representative of justice and compassion. Now meet the Sun Knight's true self—the cynical, sarcastic man who would rather be anything else than be the overbearing Sun Knight who has to speak of the Light God in all his waking hours.\n\n(Source: Odd Squad Scanlations)",
