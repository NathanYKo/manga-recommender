    "synopsis": "In her mind, everything Azusa Asahina does is for her idol, Chikashi \"Chika\" Chida of Prince 4 U. This includes getting up before sunrise to prepare for her idol's group concert by choosing the right outfit and waiting in long lines for the limited edition merchandise. Azusa's dedication ultimately pays off in the form of a lucky seat near the stage, and everything seems to be going well when a stage spotlight right above Chika crashes down.\n\nAzusa soon wakes up just outside of Heaven, and by her side is not only God but also Chika. As it turns out, they both died after Azusa's failed attempt to save Chika. As an apology for the unintentional death sequence, God promises to reverse the pair's deaths and send them back to Earth. But not even God knows how he managed to switch the bodies of the obsessive fangirl and her idol around!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
