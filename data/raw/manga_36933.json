    "synopsis": "High school student Takeo Gouda has an intimidating physique that often scares strangers away. Despite his looks, he is appreciated for his kind and manly nature, making him well liked and respected among those who truly know him. However, he has had no luck with romance. Instead, every girl he likes always ends up taking interest in his best friend—the quiet and handsome Makoto Sunakawa. \n\nOne day, Takeo falls in love with the cute and petite Rinko Yamato after saving her from an unpleasant situation. Little does he know, Rinko fell in love with him too! Oblivious, Takeo believes that Yamato is interested in Sunakawa, so soft-hearted Takeo decides to help bring the two together, even if he has to abandon his love story.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
