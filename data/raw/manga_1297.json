    "synopsis": "In order to gain a professorship at Meishin University Medical Center—with the greater goal of reforming the corrupt Japanese medical system—Dr. Akira Katou decides to focus her newest research paper on one of the most difficult surgical procedures in the world: the Batista.\n\nThe Batista, otherwise known as a reduction left ventriculoplasty, can only be conducted by those with the highest degree of skill. Because it has never been accomplished in Japan, a successful Batista will be key to securing Katou's candidacy for professorship. However, she will need an incredible team to pull it off—her first recruit being the genius surgeon, Dr. Ryutaro Asada.\n\nHaving once witnessed Asada's extraordinary surgical skills in person, Katou believes that he will be a valuable teammate. Things don't go according to plan, though, as Asada quickly causes trouble at the hospital, continuously defying the system in place. With her career on the line, Katou must find a way to keep the other surgeon in check before he derails her agenda. But if stopping him means conforming to the very system she seeks to destroy, can it really be worth it?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
