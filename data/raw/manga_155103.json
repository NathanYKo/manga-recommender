    "synopsis": "One of the most wholesome romcoms out there! How will our couple navigate their first relationship with one another?\n\n\"Hey, Kuroya... you like me, don't you?\"\n\n\"Wha—?! How in the world did you know?!\"\n\nKuroya is your average glass-half-empty high-school guy. He was convinced that his crush was way out of his league, but she had just called him out on his true feelings... He's now just about ready to die of embarrassment! The crush in question is Kasumi Shiramori, and not only is she his senior and the only other member of the literary club, but she's also one of the school's renowned beauties!\n\n\"How could she have known that I liked her?\" Kuroya thought to himself, utterly livid. Sure, we do spend a lot of time together both in and out of the club, but still!\n\n\"So... wanna go out with me?\" Shiramori finished her one-two combo with this shocking proposition.\n\n\"She likes me too?! No way! Somebody pinch me!\"\n\n(Source: Tentai Books)",
