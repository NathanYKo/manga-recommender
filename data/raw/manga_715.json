    "synopsis": "The story takes place in an ordinary Japanese town, Fuyuki City. Hidden from society, there has been a deadly war going on in this town. Seven sorcerers known as \"Masters\" summon a powerful familiar called \"Servants\" and they all fight each other till the last one. The last one is said to attain the Holy Grail which will grant them a wish. Only a few know when this War started and what the Holy Grail is, but the war was about to begin again this year.\n\nThe main character is Emiya Shirou, who lost his parents in a fire and was adopted by a man who called himself a sorcerer. Admiring his stepfather, he has been training himself to be a sorcerer. However, he had no talent and he could barely use one type of sorcery. His stepfather has already passed away, and today he's a sorcerer without any skills or knowledge. He is involved in the War of the Holy Grail when he accidentally summons Saber, who is said to be the strongest servant of all...\n\n(Source: MU)",
