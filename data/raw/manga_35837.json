    "synopsis": "Kotaro has always admired the life of the “honorable outlaw” that he’s seen so often in the yakuza movies of his youth…and it doesn’t hurt that he’s set up to inherit his grandfather’s role as the local yakuza boss! One day, after witnessing the quiet florist, Toraji, capture a purse-snatcher single-handedly, he declares him the ideal Big Brother he’s always looked for in the syndicate. From that day on, Kotaro stalks Toraji at his flowershop, all the while falling in love. Toraji’s dark past, including a criminal record from his affiliation with the yakuza, has hardened his heart against relationships…but will the ever-doting Kotaro help plant the seed of love to blossom once more?\n\n(Source: Jmanga)",
