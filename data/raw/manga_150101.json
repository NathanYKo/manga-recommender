    "synopsis": "\"The Firenze Empire will be met with a new light and darkness, but the darkness will swallow the light and bring the empire to ruin.\"\n\nIn an imperial family praised for their silver locks, Princess Ashtarte's unique black hair is immediately stigmatized as a bad omen. With her family shunning her for being the prophesied darkness, all Ashtarte wants is to be loved, and learning magic is her sole option to achieving that. One day, she stumbles upon a spell of destiny that teleports her to an unknown place. Waiting for her there is a boy in shackles named Abelion Elforman, who is anchored by a grim past of his own. Will these two be able to work together to bring light to their dark fates?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
