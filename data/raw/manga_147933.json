    "synopsis": "Orphaned at the age of seven, I was naïve to think my uncle took me in out of love. He promised to return the House of Edenbarre to me once I was of age, but he kept my father's title and wealth. Not to mention my sweet cousin poisoned me after I learned of my uncle's plans against the emperor. But with a second chance at life, I vow to take it all from them, as they did to me! Some may call me a villainess, but I'll gladly use the tyrant emperor for my selfish interests. I'll have my vengeance... as long as these suitors don't get in my way!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
