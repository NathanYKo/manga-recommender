    "synopsis": "In a land where magicians cast spells on bullets in order to perform magic, like summoning powerful monsters. There was once a witch so powerful that she challenged the gods and was cursed for it.\n\n10 years before the current time of the story, that witch challenged and defeated another magician, and in doing so saved a small boy, who instantly fell in love with her and was inspired to use guns as his \"Sword of Justice\". That boy was called Zero. When he was ready, he set out on a quest and found that woman who saved his life... or did he? She is not the same person that he idealized; she is selfish, rude, arrogant... and quite a bit shorter. But at the times when she feels Zero's love and self sacrifice for her, she can bring forth incredible power. So the two set out together to find a cure and the reason why the gods only bothered to curse her.",
    "background": "Before official serialization in Monthly Shounen Jump started (2003-07), the first three chapters were published in Monthly Shounen Jump Special Issue \"Gokujou,\" (2000-2001) and the 5th chapter in \"Jump Original\" (2002). The 4th chapter, about Kurohime's past, was never published because it was deemed inappropriate to release at that point in the serialization and instead was remade and used later on. From chapter 48 (vol.15) onwards, serialization moved to Jump SQ's official website. The chapter count restarted from chapter 1 in the 2nd volume. Mahou Tsukai Kurohime had fourteen volumes printed in English under the title Kurohime by VIZ Media from September 4, 2007 to November 4, 2009, before the series was dropped.",
