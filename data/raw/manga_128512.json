    "synopsis": "Although Arata Kishimoto was forced to repeat his first year of high school, that did not discourage him from wanting to make friends in his new class. After being assigned the seat next to the kind and popular Sachi Fujimori, Arata's first thought is to befriend her. However, months have passed, and she has yet to face Arata. Every time he tries to look at her, she quickly turns her head so that he can only see her side profile.\n\nDespite what her actions may entail, Sachi also shares Arata's sentiment. But one thing prevents her from doing so: her feelings for him cause her to be too embarrassed to show her face! As Arata's outgoing personality shortens the distance between them, Sachi gradually attempts to see more than just his profile in order to finally come face to face with the person she loves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
