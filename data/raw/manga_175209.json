    "synopsis": "Theo, the illegitimate son of the Ragnar family, a house of supreme power, struggled tirelessly but lacked the talent to break the chains of his bloodline. Ultimately, he was pushed aside in the fierce competition for the throne. Despite being a powerless bastard, his brothers sought to eliminate him, and even his own mentor betrayed him. In the end, Theo lost everything and met his death. In his final moments, filled with regret over every second of his life, an unbelievable thing happened—he was given a chance to \"return.\"\n\n\"This life will be different.\"\n\nThe returned bastard grasps his sword and plunges into the battle for the throne.\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",
