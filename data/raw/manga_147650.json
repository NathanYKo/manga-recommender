    "synopsis": "Before she was killed by a man holding a grudge against her, a woman from modern-day Korea was immersed in a wonderful fantasy novel about a courteous beauty with two powerful suitors. Duke Raffaello Kidrey was the true love of Olivia Grace, while the tyrannical Prince Regef Hill wanted her solely for himself by any means necessary. To this end, Regef exploited his foolish yet stunningly beautiful sister, Kayena, controlling her like a mere marionette before sending her to a violent death.\n\nThe murdered woman reincarnates as the villainess Kayena, but she refuses to accept another unjust end. This time, she decides to be the one pulling the strings. She allies herself with her greatest enemy, Regef, and concocts a plan to enlist Raffaello as her aide. Once she ensures that Regef is made the next emperor and Raffaello is united with his fated one, Kayena intends to escape and lead a humble life. However, royal intrigue is merciless and inescapable, and she must carefully manipulate the novel's leading men to stand a chance at survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
