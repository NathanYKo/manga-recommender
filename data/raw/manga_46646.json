    "synopsis": "Gosan no Heart (The Heart of Miscalculation)\nIn high school student Miki Toshihisa's eyes, love is troublesome, and men are wholly justified to play with women in order to satiate their libidos. In contrast to this, Ryuuta Udou is a typical gentleman, highly admired for how considerate he is when dealing with women's affections. One day, Miki overhears a girl confessing her feelings to Udou, but he becomes annoyed at her persistence in the face of Udou's courteous rejections. Wanting to lend him a hand, Miki interrupts the two and claims that he and Udou are lovers.\n\nIntrigued by Udou, Miki makes a deal with him: until Udou finds someone he likes, the two of them will enter a real relationship to avoid any further unwanted advances. However, as they start dating, Miki realizes that he is enjoying the other boy's company much more than he anticipated. To the Miki who does not believe in love and toys with women's feelings, it may be time to consider what his own heart desires.\n\nLast Summer Blues\nKuzumi dreams of playing baseball in Koshien, but after a tough defeat at a district final game, he suddenly quits baseball entirely. However, his junior Ichigaya cannot accept this decision so easily. Having idolized Kuzumi for his extraordinary pitching and devotion to the team, Ichigaya attempts to draw the ace back to the field—but Kuzumi remains adamant about his decision. Is this truly the end for Kuzumi's dreams?\n\nMuboubi na Gogo\nInfamous for his harsh behavior and impossibly high expectations of his underlings, Oomura is known as \"The Demon Boss of the Planning Department.\" While being pestered about this by Tamachi from the Sales Department, Oomura accidentally steps on and breaks his own glasses in a moment of blindness. Upon seeing Oomura prepare to go home and get a new pair of glasses, Tamachi proposes to accompany him since the former can barely see now. As they make their way to Oomura's house, Oomura discovers that Tamachi can be surprisingly kind and considerate.\n\nGosan no Date♥\nDeciding that they should do more than just have sex, Udou and Miki plan a date to visit a nearby amusement park. However, on the way to Udou's house, his devious brother gives Miki a sex toy, which leads to the couple using it right before they leave. Although he intended this date to be a break from their usual sexual intercourse, Miki might have other ideas in mind after experiencing the sex toy's abilities.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
