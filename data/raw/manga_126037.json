    "synopsis": "My name is Nozomu Torii, a plain introvert. Suddenly a new transfer student, Kyouko Kirishima, sits next to me. She's cute, kind, and for some reason, she proactively talks to me, even though I'm a nerd! A true saint.\n\nYet I want to get involved with her as little as possible because she's haunted by a \"ghost\" that only I can see! She's a little naughty, extremely pure and, in some cases, horrifying! Will I ever find a way to handle her? A romantic comedy about a \"haunted\" girl and an \"unlucky\" boy that gets your heart racing is about to begin!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
