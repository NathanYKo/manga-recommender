    "synopsis": "It's the beginning of a new era in the Egypt of pharaohs: the marriage of the young Hatchepsout and her half-brother Sethi make him the legitimate heir to the throne, under the name of Toutmosis III. Ambassadors of the gods on Earth, they shine to their people and seem at first glance like the perfect couple. However, under her mask of a perfect wife, Hatchepsout hides a deep rage... She doesn't want to just be queen, but to become the pharaoh, like her father!\n\nAs a child, she humiliated Sethi in sword combat, and nobody can beat her in shooting arrow. Why can't she achieve the greatest rank, just for being born a woman? Hatchepsout will start a war against the traditions of one of the most splendorous cultures in the world!\n\n(Source: Manga-News)",
