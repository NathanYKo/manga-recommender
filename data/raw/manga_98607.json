    "synopsis": "Owing to her silly personality, middle school student Nozomu \"Baka\" Tanaka had only one ridiculous dream: to become incredibly popular with boys in high school. However, she ends up attending an all-girls institution alongside her two best friends—Akane Kikuchi, nicknamed \"Wota\" for being an aspiring manga artist obsessed with boys love; and Shiori Saginomiya, dubbed \"Robo\" due to her cool exterior.\n\nInside the new classroom, every girl is given a somewhat unflattering nickname—but they rightfully come from their unique and eccentric characters. Having equally peculiar teachers, these girls are left to the mercy of only each other to solve all the common and often bizarre girl problems. Wasting away their high school days, Tanaka and her classmates meander through a myriad of absurd situations, away from the distracting boys.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
