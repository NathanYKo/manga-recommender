    "synopsis": "Tooru is a shy and quiet student who has developed a special crush on his close friend Ryouji, the most popular member of the high school swim team. In front of Ryouji, Tooru hides his feelings and acts as if he is just one of Ryouji's good friends, but in a moment out of the blue his world will be turned upside down as Ryouji will confess a secret desire for Tooru. Dazzled, Tooru can barely hide his excitement for Ryouji and quickly accepts his offer. As time passes, Tooru's happiness begins to fade knowing that his affair with Ryouji was just a fling based out of Ryouji's sexual curiosity.\n\nTooru, adamant about his feelings for Ryouji, confides in another one of his close friend, Kashiwazaki, about his dilemma. The two set off to devise a plan to test Ryouji's true intentions by faking a romantic relationship. Soon after, a frustrated and jealous Ryouji attempts to pry Tooru out of the arms of Kashiwazaki. Is it just as they planned? Yeah! That is of course until Tooru realizes Kashiwazaki wasn't really faking! How could he not have seen it coming?\n\nBoth Tooru and Ryouji have hidden their feelings from each other in the past, but now they have discovered that they were not the only ones. Will Tooru and Ryouji be reunited or will their true feelings for each other go unfulfilled?\n\n(Source: DMP)",
