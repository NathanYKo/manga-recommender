    "synopsis": "Keiichi Maebara has not lived in the rural village of Hinamizawa for long, but he has already made a group of close friends. His companions—consisting of Satoko Houjou, Rika Furude, Mion Sonozaki, and Rena Ryuuguu—all welcome Keiichi with open arms into their after-school club, where each day is filled with a flurry of games and penalties. However, happy faces can sometimes hide the most pain, and seemingly innocent actions can mask damning truths.\n\nStrangely enough, these events have all happened before. As one individual observes these bizarre phenomena, they take steps to change the imminent tragedy that they know is coming. With the yearly Cotton Drifting Festival quickly approaching, it becomes clear that someone close to them is orchestrating the impending doom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
