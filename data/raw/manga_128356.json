Too tired to do chores, he decides to get a robot to cook and keep house. \"Mina-chan\" is such a good housekeeper, Takuma jokes that she should become his wife. Mina takes Takuma's joke seriously, and slowly the two start doing more things together, like having a picnic outside. As time goes by, Takuma starts to fall for Mina, but can a human and a robot ever have an equal, loving relationship?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
