    "synopsis": "Twenty-five-year-old Mitsuomi Kozuka finds himself back in the countryside after recently losing his job in Tokyo. At first glance, it seemed as if time froze in the rural area where he grew up. However, it is not long until Yamato Kumai comes into his life.\n\nUnlike Mitsuomi, Yamato is cheerful and full of youth, even though the two are of the same age. Despite their contrast, Mitsuomi finds solace in Yamato's presence, making him feel right at home. But living in a closed and conservative community holds them back from being open about their feelings as they both face unsettling situations and receive critical looks from the residents.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
