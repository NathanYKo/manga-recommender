    "synopsis": "Deto and delinquent Zono are merely opponents. But then Deto discovered Zono's weakness. If his neck is touched, Zono will let out erotic sounds. Hearing Zono's erotic moans, Deto's lower-body reacted and left him confused. One day, Deto ran into Zono, who was beaten into a pulp by his father, despite being very strong in fighting. Deto rushed in to rescue Zono. And why was Zono wearing fancy, cute-looking clothes?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
