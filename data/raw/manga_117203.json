Introducing himself as her old childhood friend who moved abroad, handsome Haruma Hirose is back to do a homestay. He's totally hot, super nice, and always there when Yoh's in trouble... but could Haruma's timing be a little too perfect? Plus, the house next door, where he claims to have lived—didn't the family there all commit suicide...?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
