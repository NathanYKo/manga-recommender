    "synopsis": "Stardust Memories is a short story compilation of human beings in the distant future where we have traveled deep into space. Each story describes a moral dilemma that people traveling in space may experience which is something that we have yet to determine in the current world.\n\nStardust Memories talk about such problems as the implications of having people travel for years, even decades, in the cold, quiet and endless universe. A different story tells on how human presence in a foreign galaxy will affect the environment. The topics the author decides to write about are interesting and makes you wonder about the future.",
