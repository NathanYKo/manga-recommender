    "synopsis": "Shiota is an approachable and sometimes funny teacher. Despite his laid-back attitude, he is in love with Amai, one of his students. The story begins with them already going out! Since love between a teacher and student is forbidden, the two get roped into all sorts of awkward and funny situations as they try to hide their relationship.\n\n(Source: Manga Rock)",
