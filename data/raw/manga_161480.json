    "synopsis": "Ten years ago, a young girl saved the life of a dragon. Little did they know that they would be brought together again by the vicissitudes of fate, when Lucina's family estate is invaded by the fearsome Tayar nation led by King Hakan. After Lucina's selfish stepmother offers her up as a bride to Hakan in exchange for their lives, Lucina realizes that she is now fated to journey to the arid kingdom of Tayar and marry its seemingly brutish king. Will fate lead the unlikely pair to ruin or romance?\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
