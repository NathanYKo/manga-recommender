    "synopsis": "In a world populated by anthropomorphic animals, there exists a bias: carnivores are just mindless predators in the eyes of many herbivores. However, when an alpaca named Tem is murdered within the walls of Cherryton High School, the fear toward carnivores skyrockets to an all-time high. \n\nLegoshi, a student at this school, is a gray wolf who is quite awkward despite his fearsome appearance. When turmoil affects his school life, he is forced to confront the divide between herbivores and carnivores, as well as his own place in this society. This is further complicated by his supposedly romantic feelings toward a herbivore, which might not be what they seem.\n\nBeastars details Legoshi's struggles against his inner demons while living in a society that is unforgiving toward his kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
