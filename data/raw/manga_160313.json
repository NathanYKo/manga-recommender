    "synopsis": "Seventeen-year-old Kaede Seto only wants to be a normal teenager. Following a traumatic experience in middle school, Kaede and his two best friends transfer to a boys-only high school, hoping to start anew. Though he sets his sights on getting a girlfriend, Kaede finds it difficult to allow others close due to what had happened at his previous school.\n\nAs Kaede struggles to come to terms with his trauma, he begins to receive attention from Tsubasa Arisaka, a hopeless romantic attending an all-girls school. As an avid shoujo manga fan, Arisaka has always fantasized about a perfect love story for herself, but her life thus far has not taught her that relationships in reality differ from how they seem in fiction.\n\nTsubasa's affections spur Kaede to work harder to overcome the demons that continue to haunt him. Despite his resolve, it is not solely his personal issues that stand in the way of a happy ending for the two of them. Both Kaede and Tsubasa—immature in life and love—need to learn that real relationships are not without their own challenges.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
