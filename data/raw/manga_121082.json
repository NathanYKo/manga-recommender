    "synopsis": "Oswald \"Oz\" Carter, a young man working at a bar in Pennsylvania, is told one night to \"deal with\" a strange boy who has been loitering in the back corner of the bar for hours. Thinking that the stranger is a client for his side business—gay prostitution—Oz takes him up to his room for a rendezvous. Following an unusual conversation and a sudden kiss, Oz learns that the boy, Theodore Sullivan, came to the bar because he is on his Rumspringa, the time when young Amish people leave their communities to experience the outside world. The pair form an unlikely bond soon after, but the differences between their upbringings threaten to tear the two apart—especially when Oz learns what happens at the end of Rumspringa.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
