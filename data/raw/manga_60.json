    "synopsis": "Pi is a constant that defines a circle. It is never-ending, and to Sawaki Yumeto, it is a majestic number that has a direct relationship to his other favorite thing, boobs. One day, he realizes that there is a mystic relationship between pi and the perfect breasts. He conducted research and did calculations to determine what the perfect breasts are but he needed more raw data. Yumeto used to be unpopular and ugly, but to further his quest, he shed blood, sweat and tears to change his appearance and style to that of a handsome young man.\n\nWhen Tamura Jun, a classmate that has been absent for the majority of the school year, returns, Yumeto realizes that she might have the perfect boobs that he has been searching for. But getting to them is going to be harder than he could possibly imagine.\n\n(Source: MU)",
