Even though they should be at their most lovey-dovey, they haven't been able to make out at all... That’s because her boyfriend Yu-kun is a super exam-taking student aiming for T-University. Every day is an uneasy one without much hugging or kissing. \"Come on, I wanna do more lovey-dovey stuff!!\" \n\n(Source: Nagareboshi)\n\nIncluded one-shot: Boyfriend",
