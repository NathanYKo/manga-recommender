From his negligent and wicked family to his loyal servant and caring sister, it's all just as he had remembered. But this time, Jack is armed to the teeth with decades of experience from his previous life! He's ready to give them hell, and those that have wronged him will pay dearly. Because this time, he's invincible.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
