    "synopsis": "Average college student Totonou Kunou's usual morning making curry gets interrupted when police officers come knocking at his door, questioning him about his whereabouts on the night before. As it turns out, one of his classmates was found dead near his house—and the police take Totonou to the station as a prime suspect for murder.\n\nHaving no close relations with the victim, Totonou claims he is innocent since he had no reason to harm him. But when a witness places him at the crime scene, he must remain under custody longer than he first anticipated. When he starts to interact more with the members of the police department, they realize Totonou is no ordinary suspect. Although a bit hard to deal with, Totonou is also highly observant—as he guesses each of the members' personal dilemmas with just a handful of clues.\n\nWith evidence against him continuing to pile up, Totonou must use his deductive skills to solve the mystery behind his classmate's death to clear his name and find out who is framing him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
