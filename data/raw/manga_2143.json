    "synopsis": "Maaya Kurinoki's ordinary life is turned upside down when she fails to convince her younger brother to give ice skating a try following her successful attempt at landing a double axel. Impressed by the display of skill from a complete amateur, figure skating coach Eishi Todou recruits Maaya to become the skating partner of Shun Kanou—one of his pupils and a decorated figure skater. However, Shun is cold toward Maaya as he wants nothing to do with pair skating after a falling out with his former skating partner.\n\nWanting him to rekindle his passion for pairs' skating, Todou strikes a deal with Shun to train Maaya to be skilled enough to pass the sixth-grade skating badge test. In exchange, he will grant Shun the freedom to make his own career decisions and participate in singles' competitions. Refusing to play his coach's game, Shun rejects the proposal, but he cannot keep his eyes off of the young girl, who seems to be a natural at skating. As the two are forced to work together, will they be able to overcome their struggles and come out on top?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
