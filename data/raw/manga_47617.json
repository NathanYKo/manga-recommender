    "synopsis": "Tomoya Tadano and Yuiko Kuroki are two high school students that have recently started dating. From holding hands to walking home together, there are still many things for them to explore as a couple. However, Yuiko is a person who does everything strictly by the book and has a hard time being honest about her feelings. Although she really wants to enjoy her time with Tomoya, she often gets embarrassed and claims that performing romantic acts in public is irresponsible and indecent. Thus, she conveys her desires in a roundabout way, as she refuses to break any rules, trouble the people around them, or accept unnecessary compromises.\n\nDespite Yuiko's personality, Tomoya accepts her for who she is and goes along with her whims. For the adorable couple, every day is fun and exciting as they try out different ways to become closer to each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
