Now forced to live as a slave in the empire, the former princess adopts the name Chloe to hide her past and start anew. But when Duke Alessandro, the very man who destroyed Elpasa and attempted to kill Beatrice, takes notice of Chloe for her intellect and charm, a hide-and-seek romance between a princess in hiding and a wicked duke unfurls.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
