    "synopsis": "The angel that Taisei saw during the entrance exams was completely his ideal type. Without thinking straight, he goes up to this angel and confesses his love, but it turns out it's a guy! Now he's known as a homo even before school starts, and it turns out that guy also goes to his school! Their relationship is like a cat's and dog's, but he still really likes his face and continues bothering him. Is he an angel or a devil? Tsunderes really aren't cute at all. Two people, both with an awful mouth, fight all the time and their hearts connect like an earthquake!",
