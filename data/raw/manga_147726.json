    "synopsis": "A girl with glowing, bejeweled eyes and a tiny dragon has been found in an abandoned palace... and there is no doubt she is the long-forgotten daughter of the Emperor. Growing up wild and free, she is unaware of how special she is, especially since her eyes see things others cannot. As the Emperor and his three other children take her in and try to get closer to her, will she learn to trust them? And will this new addition to their family bring fortune or ruin to the empire?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
