    "synopsis": "High schooler Eito Tachibana has always hated his name, including all of the jokes and puns about the number 8 that have come along with it.  One day, he meets a classmate named Tomoya Hatta, a.k.a. Hachi—the Japanese word for \"8.\" What begins as casual greetings and small talk in the hallway soon becomes something much deeper, and Eito realizes that it's more than just a similar nickname that draws him to Hachi. Could the number that Eito resented for so long finally bring him something—or someone—to love?\n\n(Source: Penguin Random House)",
