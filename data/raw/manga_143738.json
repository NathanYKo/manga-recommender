    "synopsis": "Chika Hanai cannot fathom the concept of romance. During high school, she was uncomfortable with being touched by her former boyfriend, and things did not work out with the next guy her friends introduced her to, either. Clueless about the social cues around dating, she feels alienated from the rest of the world, wondering if something is wrong with her.\n\nIn hopes of figuring herself out, Chika enrolls in a college in Tokyo where a psychology professor she greatly admires teaches. By pure chance, Chika meets the professor, Shinobu Ishii, who—instead of advising her how to be \"normal\"—gives Chika the words she needed the most: she does not have to fall in love. Meeting peers who also feel differently about affection and receiving Professor Ishii's advice, Chika comes to understand that she is not alone in this confusing world and that love might not be the answer to everything.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
