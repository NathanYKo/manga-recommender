    "synopsis": "In a medieval society of magic and fantasy, young noble girl Philomena will Adina recalls memories of her past life in modern-day Japan. Despite this revelation, nothing changes; after all, she is just an ordinary girl with no secret powers to speak of. However, there are certain people with unfathomable abilities: those who wield magic. It is said that the darker one's hair color, the more potent their magic.\n\nEver since Egiedilus \"Edi\" von Ransent was born, he has been feared due to his pitch-black hair. His parents were no exception and locked him away. For years, he lived chained in the darkness, until he was saved by a high-ranking magician whom he learned to call his \"father.\" Although his living conditions improve after being adopted, he is still an outcast of society. However, there is one person his age who truly cares for him—Philomena. \n\nAs children, the two quickly grow closer and forge a strong bond. However, an incident with Edi's magic, which ultimately scars Philomena for life, causes him to enroll in the magic academy. Before he leaves, the two promise their lives to each other and become engaged, thus entwining their destinies together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
