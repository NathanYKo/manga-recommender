    "synopsis": "All sugar, no spice, and everything nice... that's the impression the beautiful first-year high schooler and \"heartthrob angel\" class president Otogi Katsura gives to those around her. In reality, Otogi is brash, assertive, and has no problem calling out a jerk when she sees one—the complete opposite of her soft spoken vice presidential counterpart, the equally beautiful and seemingly perfect Toki Ninomae.\n\nOne day, when a group of boys try to hit on her at the train station, Otogi doesn't hold back and gives them a piece of her mind—and, to her surprise, Toki enjoys seeing this side of her. Not only that, it turns out the seemingly polite, put-together vice president has a hidden side of his own... and Otogi now finds him more attractive than ever! Now \"partners-in-crime,\" Otogi and Toki agree to keep their hidden sides a secret from the rest of their classmates—but could this shared, dark secret also bring them closer together...?!\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
