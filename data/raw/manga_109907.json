    "synopsis": "At first glance, the family of Aya Kinomiya may seem quite ordinary: loving mother and father, and a kind elder brother, however, appearances can be deceiving—Aya's father constantly beats her mother, scolds her daughter, and commits other inappropriate deeds. Because of all this, Aya envies children who actually have really loving fathers.\n\nOne day, once again witnessing a quarrel between father and mother, Aya experiences a great deal of stress, due to which she gains an ability to turn invisible. At first, the girl is indulged with superpowers, but soon she makes a decision that will probably make her blame herself for the rest of her life...",
