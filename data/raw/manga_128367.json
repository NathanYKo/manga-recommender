    "synopsis": "Two college students with a shared dream and opposite paths collide–will their ambitions bring them together or pull them apart? Haruka has abandoned her dreams of the theater, but finds herself still haunted by memories. Meanwhile, Nao chases her aspirations for the stage head-on, refusing to back down or let obstacles obscure her way. When the lives of these two women cross, despite their contrary feelings, they end up entangled...as romance sparks between them.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
