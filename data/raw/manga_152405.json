    "synopsis": "When the war between the aboveground and underground ended, humanity was joined by so-called \"dungeon babies,\" those gifted with supernatural abilities and an obsession with the labyrinths below ground. Despite being a dungeon baby, Jinwoo Kim suppressed his instincts, choosing to live an ordinary life as a guide and caring for his family. But when an expedition goes wrong and he somehow ends up becoming the new owner of a labyrinth, he discovers that he cannot ignore his instincts forever...\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
