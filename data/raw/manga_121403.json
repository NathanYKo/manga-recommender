    "synopsis": "Everything seemed to be coming along for Bae Sungjoon. After graduation, Sungjoon moved to Seoul and through hard work, he saved enough money to finally afford a modest place on his own. But when a fire breaks out in his building, Sungjoon is once again left with nothing but a phone number of a former classmate—the privileged and wealthy Lee Hyo-in—whom he asks for help.\n\nIn order to get out of Hyo-in's hair as soon as possible, Sungjoon juggles multiple part-time jobs, which unsurprisingly wears him down. However, Hyo-in has a different proposition: he will pay Sungjoon to act like his dog! Although Sungjoon assumes that Hyo-in's intentions are perverted, all Hyo-in asks is that Sungjoon greets him upon returning home and occasionally go for walks together.\n\nSungjoon notices Hyo-in is handsome and his gaze is piercing; he realizes that he, in fact, is the one who wishes for their odd relationship to turn intimate—and maybe Hyo-in's true intentions are not all that innocent either.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
