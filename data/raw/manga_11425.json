    "synopsis": "Beneath the legendary Tokyo Dome lies an underground fighting arena known as Kourakuen. Here, warriors display their prowess in all manner of martial art disciplines, from the quiet control of kenpo to the heavy hits of boxing. There are only two real rules in this arena: no weapons allowed, and no rewards will be obtained. Fighters here live and die for only their honor and the chance to make their name live on forever.\n\nTeenage grappler Baki Hanma strives to earn a place among Kourakuen's fiercest combatants, utilizing a unique fighting style created through years of harsh training and suffering. Baki is the only known son of the infamous terror Yuujirou Hanma, a violent man known and feared worldwide as the \"Ogre.\" Yuujirou's brutal parenting and savage international crimes have filled Baki with trauma and hatred, fueling him to become as powerful as possible.\n\nIn a quest for revenge against his father, Baki battles the most fearsome men the world has ever birthed. Through bloody victory and crushing loss, will Baki ever be strong enough to stand his ground against Yuujirou?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
