    "synopsis": "He once helped a lonely gal from his class.\n\nOn a rainy evening, Akira Akamori, a high school student about to transfer to a new school, saw his blonde classmate, Aoi Sotome, drenched from the rain in a nearby park.\n\n\"...I don't have a home anymore,\" she said. Though Aoi was a complete stranger to him, he couldn't leave a girl alone, so he took her home. \"Thanks for the help.\"\n\n\"I-it's fine...\"\n\nWhen Akira heard about Aoi's complicated situation, he decided to help her and let her live with him until he transferred to a new school. While confused by their first time living together, the two slowly came close to each other. It is a love story of two people who repeatedly meet and part ways, like a broken record.\n\n(Source: SB Creative Corp., translated)",
