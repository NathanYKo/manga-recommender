    "synopsis": "Eiji is a high school student who lives with his father, an unsuccessful novelist. He is an introverted nerd, and even though he is poor, he remains honest and compassionate, which he learned from his late mother. He admires Aoi, the daughter of the president of a large company. However, due to their gap in status, he can barely look her in the eyes. One day, after school, Aoi greets Eiji when he comes home. She has something quite shocking to tell him...\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
