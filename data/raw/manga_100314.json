    "synopsis": "Living in the streets has its rough moments, but for the free-spirited Ryuusei, nothing beats a life without rules. While searching for leftover meals in alleyways, Ryuusei wanders into gang territory, accidentally starting a fight with rowdy thugs. Out of nowhere, a little girl charges straight at them, screaming in gleeâ€”because all she sees are cute kittens.\n\nAfter fleeing, Ryuusei roams around Nekonaki Town and discovers that the local gangs have placed restrictions on their homeless lifestyle: outsiders cannot feed on their grounds, flirt with their women, or step onto their turf uninvited. So when Ryuusei stirs up conflict with the boss of Nekonaki, he does not escape the gang's claws without punishment. Although he is constantly getting into trouble, the dark-brown tabby will stop at nothing to complete his objective: finding a male calico cat with a scarred eye. He will paw his way through the laws of stray cats, even if he has to fight them all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
