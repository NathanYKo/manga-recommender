    "synopsis": "The world has already fallen. Remaining human survivors are oppressed under the iron rule of \"zomgans\"—half-human, half-zombie hybrids who evolved from a viral outbreak that wiped out human civilization. The only thing that stands between zomgans and total domination over humanity is the Eradication Front, a ragtag band of resistance fighters that includes \"transcenders,\" humans who possess special powers. The struggle against the undead looks hopeless, until one day they come across Mirae On, a boy who can't die...\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
