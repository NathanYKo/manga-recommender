    "synopsis": "Yuki Nomoto, although a complete amateur, enjoys cooking more than anything. The young office worker has big ambitions for the dishes she wants to create, but there is a recurring problem: she has no one to share her cooking with. Much like an artistic masterpiece that never sees the light of day, Nomoto feels her efforts are wasted and her options limited if she only cooks for herself.\n\nBy a stroke of luck, Nomoto bumps into Totoko Kasuga, her neighbor two doors down, who is carrying a feast of fast food to consume all by herself. Kasuga may be intimidating at first glance, but her love for food in large quantities is exactly what Nomoto needs to push her culinary skills to the next level. With each meal Nomoto prepares for Kasuga, the two women slowly begin to open up their lives and hearts to one another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
