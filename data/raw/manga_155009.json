    "synopsis": "In the smash hit game \"Demon War 3,\" there are \"extras\" that die every day in all sorts of ways. But despite not contributing the slightest bit to the game, an extra named Evan D. Shelden has a death scene with exclusive computer graphics that stole the love of the production team! Damn it, isn't that the name I received when I was reincarnated into this game world? I, someone who isn't the main character and an extra who has too many deaths to count, must survive at all costs!\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",
