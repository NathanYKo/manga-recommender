    "synopsis": "Dr. Song Jihyun is considered a prodigy among Korean surgeons, known for her skill in saving patients no matter their condition. In her past life as Elise de Clorance, the ill-mannered wife of the emperor, her jealousy and greed had led to the loss of her loved ones and—ultimately—her death. For that reason, she vowed to now save lives instead of destroying them.\n\nAfter a fatal plane crash, Elise finds herself once again in her former body. With her previous knowledge of modern medicine and now a chance at mending her mistakes, she is determined to contribute to the empire as a medic in this life. But will Elise be able to avoid her engagement to Prince Linden de Romanoff, the man she had loved to the point of her own demise?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
