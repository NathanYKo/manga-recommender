    "synopsis": "Ruko Giya is a gyaru girl who is always at odds with the Public Morals Committee rep Shindou Tadamichi because of her tendency to show off too much skin against school regulations. In one instance, she taunts Shindou to just adjust her clothes for her since he's so damn worried about it... which he surprisingly does, with immovable determination and seriousness.\n\nHow can she prevail against a boy who'd go through such sincere lengths to preserve her dignity?\n\n(Source: MangaDex)",
