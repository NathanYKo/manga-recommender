    "synopsis": "Ordinary student Sora has been summoned to another world as one of seven \"chosen heroes\" meant to battle the Demon King. While the other six are blessed with grandiose titles and superlative stats, Sora is stuck with no title, no level, and a single, underwhelming skill: he never gets tired from walking. After being judged useless to the cause, Sora is thrown out into the streets and left to fend for himself. Nevertheless, he grows determined to turn his unjust treatment and seemingly \"useless\" skill into a positive by earning money, making friends, and seeing sights he's never seen before!\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",
