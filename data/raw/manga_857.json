    "synopsis": "Mistaken identities, bizarre accidents and pratfalls, tragic pasts and plenty of broken hearts, and that is just for starters! Love Mode tells the story of the lives of the men involved with the classy male escort service, Blue Boy. Love lines intertwine and cross, friendships are made and broken in this boy's love classic!\n\nSakashita Izumi, your typical straight high school student, gets into a sticky situation with a gay translator, Takamiya Katsura, when he gets mistaken for Izumi - an escort from B&amp;B (Blue Boy)! The two go on a date, Takamiya goes all the way with the young Izumi, and now the older man's in love with him. Tiny Problem: Izumi is slightly homophobe. Will he eventually convert in that which he fears?\n\nReiji, owner of B&amp;B and other sleazy clubs (and seemingly not gay) finds out his girlfriend had been cheating on him - just after dumping her. He bumps into a young, family-less, money-less, trustless high school named Naoya who at that moment gets knocked out by a pot that Reiji's vengeful ex-lover drops on his head. Reiji accompanies the young boy, feeling bad that this is partly his doing, only to find that now Naoya is homeless since his apartment burned down and finally ends up taking in this \"stray cat\".\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluding one-shot:\nVolume 10: The Reason I Touched Teacher",
