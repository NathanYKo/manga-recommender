    "synopsis": "Sou and Sui are twin brothers that were born to parents who love the occult and mysteries. The brothers are close, but Sou is overprotective and worrisome, often interfering with anyone that approaches Sui. Sou and Sui enter a new school and find themselves surrounded by odd characters, including a vampire, a wolf, and a couple of onmyouji, each with their own objectives.\n\nThese people were drawn to the school by some mysterious power and are searching for the source. After Sui and Sou effortlessly walk through a magical barrier, they become targeted. Arguments between the pursuers hinder their efforts, but it is eventually revealed that Sou has telepathic powers. Is that the power everyone is searching for?\n\n(Source: shinkeikaku)",
