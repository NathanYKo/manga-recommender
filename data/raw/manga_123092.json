    "synopsis": "My first impression of Ryuuga was \"This is the kind of protagonist you'd see in something like an anime.\" Then, that thought soon changed into conviction. First of all, this guy almost never talks about his past. Also, he frequently slips out of class. As soon as he comes back, he gets extremely tired, blood comes out from his lips, the sleeves and cuffs of his uniform get torn, and so forth. Furthermore, there's always beauties that are surrounding Ryuuga. The one who's like an idol within the school, Shiori Yukimiya. The cool expert of the sword, Rei Aogasaki. The mysterious transfer student, Elmira McCartney. It's very tiring for me when these people appear in front of Ryuuga. I have to frantically make a fuss by saying things like \"H-hey Ryuga! How did you get acquainted with Yukimiya!\" and \"W-why did the beautiful swordswoman Aogasaki come to the classroom to specifically meet Ryuga?!\" or \"E-E-Elmira! What is it that you see in Ryuga?!\" \n\n...so why am I doing this? That's because I, Ichirou Kobayashi, am a pro at being a friend. My life's calling is to support Ryuuga Hinomori, the protagonist among protagonists, as a close friend character.\n\nLet the curtains open for the rom-com presented by co-starring best friend, Ichirou Kobayashi!\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
