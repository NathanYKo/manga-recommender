    "synopsis": "Upon watching a breathtaking drum performance by Masami Imamura, second-year high school student Asuka Hirayama instantly falls in love with him. As she learns more about Masami, she quickly finds out that he is the older brother of her close friend Taisen. However, when Asuka realizes that the impressive drum player has a hearing impairment, indecision over whether she should continue pursuing his affection crashes down on her. Even so, Asuka remains determined to chase after the warmth blooming inside her.\n\nKingyosou narrates a young girl's endeavor to resonate with a man who has closed his heart to many people. Despite the many obstacles and heartbreak that come her way, Asuka slowly gets closer to Masami—one step at a time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
