    "synopsis": "Some people thirst for power while others want nothing more than to live low. Hamin has always been resentful of the label that comes with being his father's son—he didn't ask to be born into a mob family! After much trial and error, Hamin finally breaks ties with his family and begins to live the life he's dreamed about. That is, until he gets kidnapped and finds himself under the protection of a certain Kwon Sehyuk. All Hamin wants is his \"normal\" life back, but Sehyuk is as far from normal as a person can get...\n\n(Source: Lezhin Comics)",
