    "synopsis": "Having lost her memories of the past three years, Arisa Suzuki is surprised to learn that Mari Satou is her girlfriend. While Mari worries that she no longer loves her, it is obvious from their reunion that it was love at first sight for Arisa once more. Wanting to rekindle their bond, Mari endeavors to remind Arisa about their experiences—from their first meeting to their first kiss.\n\nYet, the task proves to be difficult as Arisa can no longer do a multitude of things. This becomes prominent when Mari describes the sex life the two shared. In the past, Arisa was very dominant in their relationship, often being the initiator. However, lacking the experience she once had, Arisa is now more timid than the person her girlfriend illustrates, causing her to envy her pre-amnesiac self.\n\nThus, the two begin to reconstruct their relationship, devotedly putting in as much effort as they can for the one they love most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
