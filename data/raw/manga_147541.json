    "synopsis": "Tsukushi has always admired her best friend Hinoka and cherishes their friendship over everything. But one night, she wakes from a startling dream—one where Hinoka rejects her romantically! Except, Tsukushi hadn't ever thought of confessing feelings to Hinoka before, but this strange dream gets her thinking. Does she have feelings for Hinoka? Was the dream some kind of foreshadowing? What would Hinoka think if she knew? As Tsukushi becomes determined to figure things out, her hyperfocus actually causes her to miss signs of Hinoka's own feelings! Will the stars align for these girls to become girlfriends? Or will they miss their chance at the perfect romance?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
