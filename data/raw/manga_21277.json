    "synopsis": "Due to family circumstances, Kodama Miyagi transfers to a new school in the middle of the term. For that reason, he must now share a room with Takao Ruizaki, a student rumored to be a dangerous delinquent. Mesmerized by his beauty, Kodama unconsciously calls him \"Rutta\"—a cute nickname contrasting his ill reputation. Instead of being mad at his new roommate, Rutta does not find an issue with it and heartily embraces his new nickname. This makes Kodama change his mind about Rutta.\n\nAs Rutta helps Kodama whenever he is bullied, the pair eventually develops a good friendship. However, out of nowhere, Rutta reveals to Kodama that he likes him. Confused about his own feelings, Kodama finds himself unable to accept his confession. But with Rutta getting into more trouble and even ignoring him, Kodama realizes that he misses him and only yearns to stand close at Rutta's side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
