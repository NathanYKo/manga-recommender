    "synopsis": "A student presents his crush with a love song that he wrote, recorded himself performing, and uploaded to YouTube, and he tells her to watch it before giving him a reply. When he returns to school the next day, he finds that the girl has shown the video to the entire class over LINE. Amid the jeering of his classmates, she snidely apologizes to him and explains that his video was hilarious enough to warrant sharing.\n\nHowever, his decision to remove the upload is curbed after a ghost is spotted within the video, and a classmate advises against its deletion. His YouTube post eventually gains popularity as the growing audience discovers more anomalies, all intent on deciphering the hidden messages that its very uploader had not even intended.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
