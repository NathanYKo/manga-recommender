    "synopsis": "With a smirk, Oota disregards his single-digit test scores and searches for a new source of amusement. He is soon captivated by his classmate Kashiwada, a mysterious student who consistently wears a blank face. Oota conspires to break her placid demeanor through scares and mischievous schemes, though his tactics always seem to backfire.\n\nOota is known as the class clown and is constantly disciplined by his teacher, who claims \"his face gives it away.\" To no fault of his own, he lacks control of his emotions and facial expressions. Kashiwada, on the other hand, seems perpetually emotionless and unreadable—no one knows what she is thinking!\n\nOota and Kashiwada are complete opposites, but that does not stop a unique relationship from developing between them. As they realize their feelings for each other, it raises an important question: do opposites really attract?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
