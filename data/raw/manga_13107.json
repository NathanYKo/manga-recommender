    "synopsis": "Today is Asami Tanakamori's first day at her new school…but it isn't exactly what she expected. In fact, it seems really strange right from the beginning!! Asami is finding it incredibly difficult to adjust to this party school, but luckily she has her new friend, a pretty \"girl\" named Akira Kinoshita. Akira seems to have the entire school at \"her\" command…but there's a bit more to Akira than Asami would have ever imagined!",
