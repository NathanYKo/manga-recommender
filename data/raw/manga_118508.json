    "synopsis": "Lee Young-joon is a perfect specimen of a man, and he knows it. Not only is he remarkably attractive, intelligent, and wealthy, but he is also the vice-president of one of Korea's top five corporations. For the past nine years, Young-joon has been accompanied by his extremely talented and diligent secretary, Kim Mi-so. She is the only person who has met the difficult vice-president's standards and the only one whom he has allowed to stand by his side, keeping her as close as a husband would keep his wife.\n\nTherefore, it comes as quite a shock to Young-joon when—despite all the years they have worked together and everything they have accomplished—Mi-so suddenly decides to resign. She proclaims that it is time for her to live her own life and, if possible, even get married. However, Young-joon is not ready to give up his beloved secretary that easily. Having grown attached to the capable Ms. Kim, Young-joon will do whatever it takes to keep her by his side. But even though he tells himself that it is only to avoid the inconvenience of finding another secretary, there may actually be a deeper reason behind why he refuses to part with Mi-so.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
