    "synopsis": "Jin Mita imagined a peaceful and stable life after quitting his job to work as a farmer in the countryside. That is why he cannot believe his eyes when he discovers a blonde knight lying unconscious in his rice field one morning. He quickly learns her name—Seraphim Stadtfeld—and how she was mysteriously transported here from a different world.\n\nWatching Seraphim struggle with the reality of being stranded in a world entirely foreign to her, Jin decides to take her under his wing. He introduces the comfort of modern country life to the bewildered Seraphim and helps her acclimate to her new environment—but in all the chaos, his neighbors start mistaking her for Jin's wife!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
