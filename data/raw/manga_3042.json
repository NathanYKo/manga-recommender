    "synopsis": "Hotori Arashiyama is an average high school girl; that is, if the definition of \"average\" includes having an obsession with detective novels and working at a maid cafe to pay off an enormous debt incurred from years of eating \"free\" curry. Whenever she is not working, she can be seen hanging out with her friends, taking care of her younger siblings, or annoying her math teacher. However, while she lives the fairly run-of-the-mill life of a teenager, she is no stranger to the paranormal and unexplained.\n\nSprinkled in with Hotori's everyday antics are occasional run-ins with the supernatural—including taking an unexpected tour of Heaven, discovering a ray gun that creates giant holes, and accidentally interfering in a dispute between some aliens. In addition, she tends to spontaneously investigate cases that strike her fancy, like uncovering the true purpose of some paintings left in a will, identifying a strange man walking the hospital grounds, and going on a treasure hunt in a far-off village.\n\nHotori manages to find herself in the middle of some strange circumstances, and yet the town moves on in spite of the oddity of it all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
