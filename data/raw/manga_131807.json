    "synopsis": "Twenty-two-year-old Haruhi Fukunaga lives her dream life in Tokyo working her long-desired job as a heavy machine operator. When her father suddenly demands that she return to the countryside to help with the family business, a frustrated Haruhi decides to visit a bar for a few drinks. The next morning, she discovers that—in her drunken stupor—she had married a man twice her age! Feeling partially responsible for the incident, Haruhi's now-husband Nagato Sunohara determines to assist his new bride in convincing her father that Tokyo is where she truly belongs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
