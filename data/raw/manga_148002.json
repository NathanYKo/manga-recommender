    "synopsis": "Jung-woo is stuck in a reincarnation cycle along with his nemesis, Shin-Ryong. Ever since he was little, he had a dream. He wanted to become strong enough to conquer Murim. However, things did not always go the way he planned. Shin-Ryong defeated him on every occasion. At this point, Ha Jung-woo had been reincarnated 5 times and was defeated yet again. When he was reincarnated for the sixth time, he is born into the modern world. Being born into a new world changes Jung-woo's goal, as there is no Murim in the modern world.\n\n(Source: NHN comico Corp.)",
