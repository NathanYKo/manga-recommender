    "synopsis": "Iizuka Sono just transferred to a new school where the reigning oddballs have their own club called \"BxB Brothers\" (\"B\" for \"Baka\" = \"Idiot\"). According to them, you make your life meaningful by doing things out of the ordinary. While Kazuhisa and Kei aren\\'t too selective about membership, Katsumi is -- so it\\'s just the three of them... Until Sono strikes Katsumi as an admirably unusual person, and he coerces her into becoming a Brother! The more Sono learns about the Brothership and Katsumi, the more pride she takes in being a Brother, but being the only BxB Sister has its problems. Caught between the open affection of Kazuhisa and the reserved admiration of Katsumi (with Kei taking school-wide bets on the side), all while struggling to register the club officially, it\\'s a BxB Triangle that constantly takes on new angles!
