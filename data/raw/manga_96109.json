    "synopsis": "Shun Aoki is an outgoing and well-liked 23-year-old new employee who catches Megumi Ira's attention for all the wrong reasons. In her eyes, he is sluggish, disrespectful, and rarely seen being productive. Therefore, 31-year-old Megumi—who sacrificed her youth to study and work—decides to supervise Shun and set him straight.\n\nAgainst all her plans, Megumi wakes up completely naked next to Shun in her apartment. However, he insists there is no need for panic and helps her recall the events of the previous night to make sense of the unfortunate predicament. A company outing, alcohol, a walk home, and a stripping game all led Megumi to one final trouble: a drunken pinky promise to go out with Shun.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
