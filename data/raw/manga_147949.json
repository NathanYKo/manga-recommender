    "synopsis": "Jinsung may look like your average college student, but in the harsh VR world of Kaillan, he's Ian, a mighty level 93 archer! So when he suddenly resets his character, everyone thinks he's totally nuts! What they don't realize is that Jinsung has unlocked a powerful, new hidden class. Now, taming monsters is tough, and leveling up is a slog. But when his VR-loving teacher threatens to fail him, Jinsung has just two months to level up and achieve glory as the one and only Taming Master!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
