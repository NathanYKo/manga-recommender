    "synopsis": "In a land wrought by attacks from beings known as \"The Sky People,\" nowhere is safe from their wanton destruction. In this dangerous land, a lone soul known as Zipher, possessing only a giant metal box, collapses on his journey to the rumored land of wizards—better known as the shunned \"variants.\"\n\nSaved by Domika, a gentle variant, and taken back to the village, Zipher is stunned by their warped features. Coming to his senses, he instantly seeks out the chief, hoping to beg a boon. After all, the strange magics the variants wielded were incomprehensible to outsiders, and the power over life was surely theirs as well.\n\nBut the variants distrust outsiders, and not all are as welcoming as Domika. As Zipher strives to have his wish granted, Pandemonium: Majutsushi no Mura depicts an otherworldly land of beings unique in appearance yet achingly familiar at heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
