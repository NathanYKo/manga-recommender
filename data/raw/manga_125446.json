    "synopsis": "A month has passed since a declaration of peace, and, ever since then, the big city disposes of trash outside its walls—including the expendable humans. Every day, the hungry scour the heap of waste for food. Among them is the young, brave ex-soldier Orga, together with his sister Harika, who gives him the strength to persevere. The siblings, along with Orga's best friend Nick, barely scrape by.\n\nOrga collects potentially valuable junk to save enough money and provide the three of them with a comfortable life away from the impoverished streets. But while Orga works, Nick intends to accelerate their salvation; he proposes a plan to Harika—one that only she can execute.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
