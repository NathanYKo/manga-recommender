    "synopsis": "Living in Asagaya, 29-year-old Hiroto Ikuta spends his days working at his part-time job and chatting with the locals. He likes visiting Hanae Wada most, a grumpy yet kind elderly woman whom Hiroto calls \"Granny.\" Hiroto's time with Granny is sadly cut short when she passes away from a heart attack. To his surprise, Hiroto inherits Granny's house as she never married or had children.\n\nThree months later, 18-year-old Natsumi Kobayashi moves from her hometown to attend art school. With nowhere else to go, she stays with her cousin Hiroto, whom she has not seen in years. Despite their opposing personalities, the pair begin living under the same roof as they struggle through their seemingly mundane lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
