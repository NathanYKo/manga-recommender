    "synopsis": "Maeda Hachibei is peculiar, because, when most males lusting after gorgeous females, he instead lusts after discrete parts. When he relocates to Tokyo to attend school, he finds himself living in a dormitory with five females, each possessing a distinct ideal physical trait he desires: gorgeous blue eyes, bullet-train breasts, a deep dulcet voice, and straight \"anime-esque\" legs. Can he manage to keep his wits when these women surround him? Although you would not be completely incorrect if you believe this is like Love Hina… Hachibei is no Keitaro. \n\n(Source: Musashi Quality)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 12: The Boy Who Heard Too Much",
