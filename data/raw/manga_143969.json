    "synopsis": "In a boisterous classroom, 15-year-old Aia Udagawa's thoughts are far from the topic at hand. While his classmates select him as a model for the Aoi Festival Artist Contest due to his past modeling experience, Udagawa watches Jun Sumisaki, a tall and awkward girl who seems embarrassed about her unique freckles and impressive height. They are paired as model and stylist—but Udagawa defeatedly mourns his abandoned dream of becoming a makeup artist.\n\nUdagawa has long convinced himself he has no talent, and Sumisaki lacks the confidence to hold her head high and flaunt her stunning features. Even so, Sumisaki proposes that they switch: Udagawa will have all creative freedom, and she will boldly strut the runway like her mother once taught her. Notable figures from the glamor industry will be watching, but it may prove to be the push Udagawa needs to return to the fashion and beauty scene and conquer it alongside his favorite model.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
