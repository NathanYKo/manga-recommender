She is also wiser than most men and she hopes for a higher intellect.\n\nEven if that man is an enemy, both are full of lies and conspiracies. She is not fond of that man. But between a choice the love and loyalty, she will begin to think that she isn't as meaningful as she once thought she was...\n\n(Source: Chinatown KM)",
