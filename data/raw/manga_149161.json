    "synopsis": "Luca Winterwald's childhood was bleak: he never knew his father, his mother passed away, and he was left in the care of his greedy and abusive aunt, Judith Maibaum. Upon turning 10 years old, his uncle and only ally, Viscount Ruediger, takes him to the Winterwald Duchy, where Luca is to succeed the title of duke and embark on a bloodstained journey of vengeance against those who doubt his legitimacy.\n\nA fan of the novel depicting Luca's revenge story unexpectedly reincarnates as Judith—the first minor villain to die. Wishing not to waste her second chance at life, she decides to change Judith's fate and lead an unassuming life once Luca leaves with Ruediger. Although Luca distrusts Judith's sudden kindness, on the fateful day of Ruediger's arrival, he refuses to part with his aunt!\n\nIt may be completely off-script, but Judith joins Luca, swearing to use her knowledge of the plot to both save herself and ensure the future happiness of her adorable nephew.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
