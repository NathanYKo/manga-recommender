    "synopsis": "What links together two bands of worshippers, one deep in the Arctic snows, one hidden in the bayous of Louisiana, is more than their shared practice of blood sacrifice.\n\nIt is the inhuman phrase they both chant: Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn—\"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\" Now these nightmares will disturb the sanity of Francis Thurston, a young man pursuing an investigation into the cult of Cthulhu that leads to the most forsaken spot in the vast Pacific...and to Earth's supreme terror, the risen corpse-city of R'lyeh.\n\nFirst published in 1928, The Call of Cthulhu, rendered in chilling detail by modern manga horror master Gou Tanabe, is the most famous of all of H.P. Lovecraft's stories, and was the namesake of the acclaimed role-playing game system set within the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\n(Source: Dark Horse)",
