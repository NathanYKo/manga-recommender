    "synopsis": "Second-year high school student Misuzu Moritani is reserved and has trouble communicating with her peers. However, she possesses an uncanny ability to stop time for around three minutes a day, which she liberally uses to escape any sort of interaction.\n\nWalking around the school during one of her time-freezes, she sees the beautiful Haruka Murakami sitting by herself. Letting curiosity get the best of her, Misuzu lifts up Haruka's skirt to take a peek at her panties, only for the girl to ask her what she was doing. This sudden response shocks Misuzu, bringing confusion as to how Haruka was able to move when everyone else is suspended in animation.\n\nRather than lashing out, Haruka asks Misuzu for help, offering an unconventional method of payment for her troubles. But, as the socially awkward Misuzu gets more involved with the secretly troublesome Haruka, the latter's true intentions gradually become more apparent.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
