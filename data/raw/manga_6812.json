    "synopsis": "On their first day of class, first-year high school students Takashi Mitsuhashi and Shinji Itou immediately become friends. The duo seems to have quite a bit in common on the surface. Both of them aspire to emerge as delinquents upon entering their new school, and they begin to wear obnoxious haircuts to make them stand out from other teenagers.\n\nHowever, despite being a feared pair, these two students actually have more differences than similarities. Itou wants to use his fists to protect the weak, earning respect and admiration from his classmates. On the other hand, Mitsuhashi strives to be the strongest in Japan—striking fear in anyone watching him.\n\nRegardless of these dissimilarities, the two are notorious for their remarkable fighting abilities, and their friendship thrives when they come together to throw fists. Whether it be a fight against the good or the bad guys, nobody can win against these two unusual delinquents.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
