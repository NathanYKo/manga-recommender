A very satisfying one night affair has now turned into more—she's pregnant! Fate brings them together again, and now the regimented Doo-joon is determined to do the right thing and marry her. But they're basically strangers! Except... their bodies have been very intimately acquainted. What's this mother-to-be to do?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
