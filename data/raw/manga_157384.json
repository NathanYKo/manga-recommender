    "synopsis": "Can a determined tengu bride change a lonesome bachelor's ways? Well, it's not like he's got much of a choice— 'cos she's already moving in! Young systems engineer Kotarou has had to make his own way in life. Nothing remains of his early childhood before he was orphaned—nothing except his grandparents' antique house in Hachioji and memories of Hime, the winged spirit girl he's come to dismiss as a youthful flight of fancy. But after his return to Hachioji and reunion with Hime, it becomes impossible to deny the existence of his fine, feathery friend—especially given that she's declared they're getting married at second sight!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
