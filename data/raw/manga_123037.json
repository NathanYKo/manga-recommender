One night, the answer to their prayers comes from... the WOLF Tribe? Monthly food rations for two years, enough for their whole village, in exchange for one of their own to betroth the Kuroe Family's son. After a long journey to the Wolf Tribe, Kaede, who has sworn to find happiness in his new life, is immediately thrown into a pre-marriage ceremony with his new fiancé, Ren. What will Kaede do after meeting the completely insufferable and mean Ren, who he has to marry?!\n\n(Source: Fantasista Inc.)",
