    "synopsis": "Soru is a princess born from illegitimacy, and able to see ghosts although she is completely blind. Jahyeon is a heroic general who possesses the sun's aura which can chase away spirits. Yato is the deadliest and most beautiful ghost, but his heart can't feel anything. Soru and Jahyeon become bound to one another in an undesired marriage, but they both need each other—she needs his aura, he needs her divine blood. As Soru's unconditional sacrifice and love toward Jahyeon slowly melts his frozen heart, the same happens to Yato's emotionless heart. All three have something that they need and want from one another. Could they become the salvation they need for one another?\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
