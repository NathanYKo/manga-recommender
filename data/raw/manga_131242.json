    "synopsis": "Kazunari Kyougoku is the boss of an up-and-coming trading company in the Taishou era. With his unparalleled negotiation skills to close every deal he sets his eyes on, he has started to gain popularity among his competition. Yet despite this momentum, his success was not earned through bargaining alone—he possesses the ability to hear other people's thoughts. This power has allowed him to see through the lies of many, causing him to distrust others.\n\nWishing to bring even more prosperity to his business, Kazunari plans on marrying the daughter of the noble Suwabe family. His proposal is accepted, and he soon learns something about his future bride. The daughter, Nana Suwabe, is unable to speak. With this information, Kazunari is delighted to know that he will only have to hear Nana's inner voice.\n\nHowever, upon meeting her, he quickly realizes that he is unable to hear her thoughts. Having lived his entire life hearing the intentions of others, Kazunari endeavors to slowly understand his partner's true feelings and discover a harmonious future together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
