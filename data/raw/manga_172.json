From digital teachers to cars that drive themselves, computers are an integral part of everyone's lives—everyone's, that is, except Yui Kasuga's. The 14-year-old daydreamer can't tell a Pentium chip from a Dorito! Very shortly, she will be called on to save the world from the mother of all computer viruses... and she can't even be bothered to stay awake in class!\n\n(Source: MU)",
