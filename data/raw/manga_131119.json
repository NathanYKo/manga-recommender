    "synopsis": "Nobukuni is in love with Sasaki, a boy who sits next to her in class. But how can she get him to notice her? A deep dive into teen magazines and heeding the advice of a cool girl in class gives Nobukuni all kinds of ideas: try to sleep cutely at her desk, flash a little skin, and kindly waft some of her pheromones in Sasaki's direction. She's not getting much of a reaction, so she fears it isn't working—little does she know he's hiding some secret feelings of his own! A delightful romantic comedy about young passion and the (awkward) act of seduction!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
