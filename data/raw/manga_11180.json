    "synopsis": "Shoutarou Ninomiya, a father of two boys, is a workaholic who has taken no paid leave for 15 years. This comes at the cost of neglecting his family, causing his wife to file for divorce. Similarly, Natsumi Okajima, a mother of two girls, has had enough of her husband's adulterous behavior and leaves him. \n\nTaking their children, both Shoutarou and Natsumi buy new houses to have a fresh start to their lives. However, they are conned by the same person in an elaborate real estate scam, resulting in the pair purchasing the same house! With little ground for legal dispute and insufficient funds to relocate, the two families are forced to live together. \n\nNatsumi, being distrustful of men, keeps clear boundaries in the house. But as their children warm up to each other, the two adults' lives become ever more intertwined, and a sweet romance blossoms between them. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
