    "synopsis": "Coming from a poor family, Shinobu Indou is overjoyed to be accepted into a prestigious all-girls military academy. While searching for the campus, Indou bumps into two upperclassmen, Fujino Kagami and Koto Ooba. Kagami criticizes Indou's unkempt appearance and questions her reasons for attending the academy. However, Ooba kindly greets Indou and offers to take her to a local bathhouse. As the girls finish their bath, Ooba is shocked by Indou's incredible beauty beneath the dirt.\n\nOn the first day of school, Indou notices a surprising amount of attention centered on her—especially coming from Kagami, who is tasked with supervising Indou's group. Despite Kagami's harsh first impression, she gently welcomes Indou to the school with a kiss on her forehead when the two are alone, leaving Indou speechless. As Indou navigates her new life in the academy, she struggles to make sense of Kagami's sudden change in behavior.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
