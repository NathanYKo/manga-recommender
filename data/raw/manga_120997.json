    "synopsis": "Ever since middle school, Aya Kurata has harbored a crush on her male classmate Kouta Yokomizo. Now a high school student, she also becomes close with a girl named Sara Mizuki, but both her friends end up falling for each other. Seeing how neither Yokomizo nor Sara will confess their feelings, Aya decides to help the two become a couple. Although Aya recognizes that she must move on from her infatuation, she finds that her feelings do not disappear so easily.\n\nWhile attempting to overcome her heartbreak, Aya finds herself confiding in an enigmatic older boy named Ryuu. Despite expressing sympathy for her, Ryuu questions whether it was necessary for her to give up her own happiness for the sake of her friends. Contrary to Aya's pure way of thinking, Ryuu believes real love is a poison that makes people selfish. Without disclosing his motives, he challenges Aya to be more honest with herself. With his support, she may rediscover romance much sooner than she expects.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Netsu wa, Natsu ni Nido Agaru",
