But after she summons Sharkiller, a creature capable of transforming into Hollywood's most ferocious B-movie sharks, nobody's laughing now! In fact, they're running for their lives! With her bloodthirsty buddy chomping at the bit to kill everyone in sight, can Shiromi defeat the Demon King and end his reign of terror? Or maybe the realm would be better off if she didn't...?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
