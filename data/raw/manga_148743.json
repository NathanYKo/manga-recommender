    "synopsis": "When the discourteous and incompetent Meldenique \"Mel\" Babelloa leaves her affluent household with a smile, it shocks even her family who despise her. For political reasons, Mel is engaged to Duke Lennox Hessman, but he is having an affair with her half-sister, Sheria. Moreover, all the businesses Mel has tried to start so far have failed due to her loathsome stepmother's schemes. But now, Mel has only one thing on her mind: opening her own stationery shop!\n\nIn her first life, Mel was a lonely orphan in Korea. However, adorable pens, unique toys, and sweet snacks unfailingly brought a smile to her face. After reincarnating as Mel, she wants nothing more than to share joy with kids who may need a safe space. With this new purpose in mind, Mel seeks indispensable allies and relies on their magical expertise to create delightful and diverse memories for precious children. But she used to be a villainess of this world—and the people who despise her are prepared to do anything to see her business collapse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
