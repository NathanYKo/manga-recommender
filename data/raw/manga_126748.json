    "synopsis": "Ritsuko Kaji, an author of short stories, finds herself unable to write. On a certain day, a remnant from Ritsuko's past reemerged. Aoi, a male friend she used to completely confide in, appears in a dream and asks her, \"Your life... is that really it?\". The next morning, Ritsuko is awakened by a phone call. Aoi has committed suicide. The glimmer of a forgotten dream, the day-to-day of a modern couple, the death of someone irreplaceable...\n\nA life of \"loss\" that she had always averted her eyes from begins to move...\n\n(Source: Shogakukan, translated)",
