    "synopsis": "Rin sells her body for a living after her parents passed away. The other villagers conspire against her, and eventually they take it upon themselves to kick her out of town for lowering the town's morals. With nothing but the clothes she's wearing, some coins, and a loaf a bread her childhood friend Yuu gave her, Rin sets out with no goal in mind. What will she find in the forest as night falls?\n\n(Source: Antisense Scans)",
