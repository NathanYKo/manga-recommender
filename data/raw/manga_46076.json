    "synopsis": "In an effort to turn the tides of war against the dark elves, Elf Princess Silenia is sent to the human world to abduct the coveted \"elf lover\" and return to Eluveitie. The subsequent union of elf and man will result in the birth of a savior possessing immense magical power.\n\nWhen Silenia emerges from a portal within her potential suitor's toilet, the elf lover’s pristine image of her kind is shattered. Forceful and condescending, she ends up driving the human into the arms of the dark elf Dilein. Having not learned her lesson, Silenia continues to belittle the new couple in her numerous attempts to win him over.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
