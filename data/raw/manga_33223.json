    "synopsis": "The story of AkaAka begins with a dream filled with red camellia and the passing of a strange mask. The owner of this mask is a young boy named Yue who lives at a temple populated with rather unusual residents. The nearby town Utsuwa is holding a winter festival. Kurogitsune, his fox spirit friend, decides it's the perfect opportunity for the sheltered Yue to experience the sights, sounds, and most of all—the food! Even though Yue is forbidden to ever leave the temple, they sneak into town, not realizing what they've set into motion...\n\n(Source: the manga habit)",
