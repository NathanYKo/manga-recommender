    "synopsis": "I am Ilshin Yoo, a failed, third-rate web novel author. Don't start praying at me just in case because you think I'm a god. It's just my name. This is foul world where only hunters are appreciated. But even if you awaken as a hunter, not all hunters end up the same. It's a life dependent on hunter rank, which normally wouldn't change once it's been set. One day, I was able to awaken just as I had desperately wanted. But my awakened ability is somewhat strange. In this little world connected to my smartphone, those insignificant and weak ants being slaughtered consider me their god? And someone as insignificant as me has to save the world? Is that correct?\n\n(Source: Naver Corporation, translated)",
