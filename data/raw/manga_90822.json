    "synopsis": "Shoukichi is a failing hairstylist who struggles to attract customers due to his unwelcoming personality. One day, he is insulted by a beautiful man named Fukusuke, who turns out to be a renowned stylist and Shoukichi's new coworker. The two constantly clash at work; Shoukichi keeps up his stern, professional attitude, whilst Fukusuke dominates the salon with his charming, silver-tongued ways.\n\nWhen an incident results in Fukusuke missing his last train home, Shoukichi lets him spend the night at his house out of pity. However, he wakes up in the middle of the night to find Fukusuke inappropriately pleasuring himself over his face. Disgusted at the suave man's assault, Shoukichi's hatred for Fukusuke only intensifies.\n\nDespite the tension between them, Shoukichi finds himself growing fond of his absurd colleague after Fukusuke saves him from an unsavory encounter. With his heart clouded by confusion, Shoukichi must decide whether to trust Fukusuke or stay alert for any hidden sinister motives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
