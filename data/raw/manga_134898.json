    "synopsis": "At his job working in an arcade, \"Mobuo\" gets pretty much ignored by everyone–even his nickname references the way he blends into the background like some kind of NPC. All that changes when gorgeous, larger-than-life Nanora Yaegashi barges into the place and demands his help learning the ins and outs of the arcade's trickiest games. And did she just ask him out?! One thing's for sure, it's the beginning of a summer full of arcade fun and simmering sexual tension!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
