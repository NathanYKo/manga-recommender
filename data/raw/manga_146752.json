    "synopsis": "Nicknamed the \"school for future criminals,\" Yusung Technical High School isn't exactly the ideal place to study. A rarity among his peers, Gamin is a student with just one goal: to get into university. At a school where it's every man for himself, he is rejected from countless study groups before he decides to form his own. When Hankyeong, Gamin's former tutor, joins his high school in hopes of earning her teacher certification, it seems like they're both reaching for the impossible. Can they defeat the odds and achieve their dreams?\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
