    "synopsis": "On the dangerous streets of Chicago, Rally Vincent not only runs a gun shop under the name GunSmith Cats, but also lives on the edge of the law as a bounty hunter. With razor-sharp shooting skills and driving finesse worthy of the most thrilling Hollywood chases, Rally plunges into a world of ruthless mobsters and powerful criminals with scores to settle that put her life on the line. Every mission tests her limits, but it's the moral dilemmas that threaten to break her own code.\n\nFortunately, Rally isn't alone. Beside her is a group of loyal companions, including Minnie-May Hopkins: an explosives expert whose turbulent past contrasts with her energetic personality and sharp humor, complementing the pragmatic Rally. Along with trusted allies like Becky and Roy, these bonds go beyond the professional, offering her stability in a world where any mistake can cost everything.\n\nGunSmith Cats isn't just raw adrenaline and intense shootouts; it's a meticulous portrayal of firearms and muscle cars, each depicted with obsessive precision and details, along with a great selection and variety. Kenichi Sonoda crafts a gripping tale of crime and friendship, packed with explosive action reminiscent of classic action films, but balancing harsh realities with heart. In a world where morality is blurred, sometimes the only thing left is to trust your triggerâ€”and the ones who have your back.\n\n[Written by cymogus]",
