    "synopsis": "Miho Yoshida has been looking for a place to live. After some searching, she visits the home of Fuuka Asou, who is renting out a room on the second floor. The two discuss their situation, including the history of Fuuka's roommatesâ€”most of whom were male. Feeling the need to let her know up front, Fuuka comes out to Miho as a lesbian.\n\nWith the sexuality of her roommate not an issue to the open-hearted Miho, she promptly moves in. Flirty jokes directed at her from Fuuka and her attractive female friends become commonplace. But as feelings change and the jokes become more serious, Miho is put in a dilemma. When Fuuka romantically closes in, why does Miho feel so happy?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
