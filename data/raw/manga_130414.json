    "synopsis": "Keeping spirits high against the relentless burdens of adulthood can be challenging. For a manga artist constantly facing stressful deadlines and her unemployed girlfriend who takes loafing seriously, productivity is hardly a priority. Rather than acting responsibly as adults should, the two work hard to indulge themselves, reveling in the simplest of things—from experiencing a day without internet to embarking on impromptu trips to locations afar. No matter the circumstances, the couple explores fun and creative ways to escape their reality, possibly finding more than just fleeting moments of freedom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
