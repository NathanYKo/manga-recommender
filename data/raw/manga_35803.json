    "synopsis": "Hungry for the taste of the big city, Akira Takanashi moves to bustling Tokyo. But before he can even begin his new life, he finds that both his company and dormitory have closed down. In an act of desperation, Akira contacts his childhood friend and pen pal, Chihiro Ooba, who allows him to live in his luxurious apartment for free.\n\nBetween shameless freeloading and half-hearted job surfing, Akira suddenly gets entangled in Chihiro's wealthy family's affairs—as his bodyguard. Wishing to return Chihiro's kindness, the endlessly grateful Akira keeps an eye on him at all times. However, the two living together allows unexpected memories to resurface, and new feelings find their way into the young men's hearts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
