    "synopsis": "Every year, a class is randomly chosen to be placed in a deserted area where they are forced to kill each other in order to survive. Initially believing to be on a graduation trip, Shuuya Nanahara and the rest of Shiroiwa Junior High's Class B find that they have been chosen to participate in this game of life and death known as The Program.\n\nWaking up to the realization that they have been quarantined on an island, the 42 students discover they have been fitted with metal collars which will detonate if certain conditions are not met. In order to obtain freedom, they must slaughter everyone else by whatever means necessary, and the last one standing is deemed the winner. As each member of the class heads down their own path, Shuuya makes it his goal to get off the island without playing the game in order to put an end to this madness once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Battle Royale was published in English by Tokyopop from May 13, 2003, to April 11, 2006. The Tokyopop version was extensively rewritten by Keith Giffen, which eventually led to contradictions and plot holes in later volumes. Tokyopop rereleased the series in five omnibus volumes under the name Battle Royale: Ultimate Edition. It was also published in Italian by Edizioni Play Press from May 1, 2003, to September 1, 2005; in Spanish by Editorial Ivrea from March 2004 to August 2006; in Brazilian Portuguese by Conrad from November 2006 to November 2011; and in Polish by Waneko from March 1, 2012, to March 1, 2015.",
