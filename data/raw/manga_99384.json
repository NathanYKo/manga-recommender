    "synopsis": "Shingo Kazami is a federal veterinarian who works at a Livestock Hygiene Service Center. One day, Shingo finds himself suddenly summoned to another world. The prince of the world he is summoned to asks Shingo to help him save the people of his land. The land is a fantasy world filled with magic and monsters. However, because civilization, science and medicine are undeveloped, many people die from disease and natural disasters... What kind of vet lets lives be taken without trying to protect the people and animals? He might not be the strongest fighter, but when he sees the circumstances of the new world, he vows to do all he can to save as many lives as he can...\n\n(Source: AlphaPolis)",
