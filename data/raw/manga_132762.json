    "synopsis": "The world has yet to witness the true star power of 30-year-old Takara Takarada. He is a marvelous actor on stage, but behind the curtains, he is sloppy, scatterbrained, and incapable of learning his lines. That is where his longtime friend and fellow actor, Yuujin Kamoshima, steps in. Recognizing Takarada's immense talent to effortlessly command attention, Yuujin has decided to support his friend's road to stardom. He handles Takara's chores, helps him memorize his lines, and meticulously choreographs every movement to highlight his extraordinary showmanship.\n\nWhen a talent agency scouts Takara and offers him a guest role in a new television series, problems arise. He struggles to understand the character on his own and follow the inconsistent acting directions, realizing only Yuujin can save him. Thanks to Takara, Yuujin gains opportunities to further his own career—but it soon becomes clear that their co-dependent relationship cannot last forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
