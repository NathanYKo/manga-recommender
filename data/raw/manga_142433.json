    "synopsis": "Haruki Satou is a carefree second-year high school student who enjoys soccer and all things fun. He is also interested in Nozomu Kisaragi, his mysterious seatmate known for her long bangs that fall over her eyes. Ever since their first year, Haruki has longed to catch a glimpse of Nozomu's bare face.\n\nWhile cleaning up the classroom after school, Haruki opens a window and lets a strong breeze in, revealing Nozomu's surprisingly strong, piercing gaze and attractive features. Flustered, Nozomu explains that her intimidating look is the reason she hides behind her hair. However, Nozomu turns out to be Haruki's ideal type, and he quickly falls for her, thus beginning his quest to get close to her and eventually confess his feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
