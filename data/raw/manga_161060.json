    "synopsis": "Sometimes, when life is hard, you just need a \"friend.\"\n\nWorking at a game company, Rihito Ootsuka (23), is a \"normal\" guy who is a steady presence on and off the job. Noa Saotome (27) is a \"hard-core\" woman who likes to go all out at everything she does. Two people who usually wouldn't get along become \"friends\" by chance...? This is a start of an workplace \"friendship\" comedy that's a little sweet but also a little heavy!\n\n(Source: Shueisha, translated)",
