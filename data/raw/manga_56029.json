After her high school debut was delayed, however, she finds herself isolated in the class.\n\nNext to Akina sits Kaede Sasamura, an otaku girl who can turn into a bishoujo with her glasses off. Akina decides to get Kaede out of the otaku life and groom her for a perfect high school life, but the only way to get close to Kaede is for Akina to pretend to be a Precure otaku herself to her chagrin...\n\n(Source: Batoto)",
