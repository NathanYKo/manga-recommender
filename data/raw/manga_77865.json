    "synopsis": "Fifteen days following the final war in the Gobi Desert, the desolate biome has become nearly impossible to survive in. With the last flight off of the planet departing in four days, the few remaining survivors struggle to make their way to the port and catch the final flight. Although Jay and Ellen only have three more days of travel before they reach the port, Ellen is beginning to reach her limit as their rations run out. Determined to make sure they both make it out alive, Jay decides to scour an old colony wreckage for supplies.\n\nElsewhere, a woman named Angel Reagan finds herself offering her body to a group of savage men in exchange for some water for her younger sister. Just as things are about to intensify, the men are brutally murdered in front of her eyes by a man with a body made of metal. Introducing himself as Noah, the \"hero\" indiscriminately kills any hostile force against him, much to Angel's dismay. But Noah's moral reasoning for his actions slowly becomes clear for Angel the longer they spend time in an environment that brings out the worst in humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
