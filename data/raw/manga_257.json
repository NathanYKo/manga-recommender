    "synopsis": "Commonly mistaken as a doll, the Hybrid Child is a toy that can adapt human abilities—from reading books to conveying emotions. Their capability relies on the degree of affection their owner provides them. Nurture them with the best affection and the model will flourish.\n\nTogether for 10 years, the slothful Kotarou Izumi believes that Hazuki—a Hybrid Child whom he owns—will be in his life for eternity. But everything comes crashing down when the artificial human suddenly collapses.\n\nHybrid Child manifests the struggles of the Hybrid Children and their owners through three brief narratives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
