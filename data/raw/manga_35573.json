    "synopsis": "One morning, Naho Takamiya receives a letter in the mail claiming to be from herself 10 years in the future. The letter reveals a series of events that are supposed to take place that day. At first, Naho thinks it's just a prank; but when the letter mentions a transfer student named Kakeru Naruse, who really ends up transferring into her class later that day, she is forced to believe in its contents.\n\nAs Naho continues to read the letter, her future self mentions several regrets, urging Naho to take the right decisions now. Somehow these regrets all seem to be connected to Kakeru, and with the burden of the knowledge that the boy wouldn't be with her and her friends in the future, will Naho be able to make the perfect choices that will alter what seems to be fate?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nAlso includes Haru-iro Astronaut (Spring-Colored Astronaut) series.",
    "background": "After chapter 9 ran in Bessatsu Margaret magazine in November 2012, Orange went on hiatus for over a year. In 2013, the series switched publishers from Shueisha to Futabasha, which re-published the first two volumes, and starting from chapter 10, serialization moved to Monthly Action magazine starting in the February 2014 issue. After the series finished serialization in the October 2015 issue, side stories were published intermittently in the April 2016 through July 2017 issues, and on Web Action from July 16, 2021 to April 8, 2022. The series has sold a total of 1.6 million copies since it was serialized, with the fourth volume ranking 25 on Oricon's weekly manga rankings chart. Orange also ranked 15th among male readers in the 2015 Kono Manga ga Sugoi! magazine. A live-action film adaptation was released in Japan on December 12, 2015. The first five volumes of Orange were published in English by Seven Seas Entertainment in two omnibus volumes from January 26 to May 31, 2016, the sixth volume on January 23, 2018, and the seventh on March 7, 2023. Crunchyroll published the manga digitally starting on January 24, 2014. It is also published in Spanish by Tomodomo Ediciones, in Polish by Waneko, and in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora Jbc.",
