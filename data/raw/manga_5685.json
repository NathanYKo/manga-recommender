    "synopsis": "Five years ago, almost every villager of Ootsuka died due to a tragic plague. But mysteriously enough, three survivors: a girl and two boys, emerged. Now living in a church, the three live in isolation, hidden from those who may seek to find them. Shino, one of the survivors, has control over the power of Murasame, the blade of life. But when the imperial church seeks to take the Murasame for themselves, their peaceful life becomes a thing of the past...\n\n(Source: Bliss)",
    "background": "Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun was first serialized in Ichirachi magazine from June 2005 to September 2009. It then went on hiatus until January 2011, wherein the mangaka, Abe Miyuki, moved to Kadokawa Shoten, continuing the serialization in CIEL magazine. On August 30, 2014, the series moved to quarterly Emerald magazine. Kadokawa Shoten republished all thirteen volumes that were published by Tosuisha in a 10-volume format. The series has spanned into multiple adaptations including two drama CDs released on September 21, 2007 and July 25, 2008 and a two-cours anime adaptation which aired in 2013. In 2015, a musical was staged in Theatre Sun Mall between August 14 and 23.",
