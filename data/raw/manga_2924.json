    "synopsis": "Alexander the Great is a name known around the world as belonging to one of the greatest military commanders in history. But due to the grandeur of his name and enormity of his achievements, his right-hand man Eumenes remains a lesser-known historical figure. Eumenes led a turbulent life, overcoming numerous struggles and traveling great distances to meet and befriend many of the most influential names of his time.\n\nOne does not become the right hand of Alexander the Great by mere birth. Eumenes fought for his position with fierce talent, intellect, and confidence. This is his story. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Historie tells the fictional story of Eumenes, a historical figure who was the secretary and general to Alexander the Great. Since Eumenes' past is largely a mystery, manga author Hitoshi Iwaaki was able to take artistic liberty. The series won the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival Grand Prize in the Manga Division in 2010. In 2012, the manga won the Grand Prize at the 12th Osamu Tezuka Culture Prize. The series has been published digitally in English by Kodansha USA through K Manga.",
