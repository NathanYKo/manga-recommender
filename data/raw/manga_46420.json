    "synopsis": "While walking to school, Kazusa Uemura is hit by a car and killed on impact. Now a ghost overlooking her corpse, she is greeted by Kyuuji Sakai, who informs her that souls remain on Earth for a bit after death. During this time, ghosts have to be careful not to become onryou—vengeful, negative spirits that linger to torment the living. Soon after watching her funeral, Kazusa follows her crush Mitsuhara \"Miharu\" Torii, only to find out that he never liked her, instead having a crush on a girl named Ranko Okabe.\n\nFilled with envy, Kazusa screams at Miharu, trying to understand how he really felt about her. While doing this, Okabe seems to notice her, making Kazusa realize that she can be seen from the afterlife if she focuses her own negative emotions on her crush's crush. Stuck having to choose between moving on to the afterlife or becoming an onryou to haunt Okabe after her untimely death, Kazusa must decide how she wants to spend the rest of her eternity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
