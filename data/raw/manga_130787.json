There, he soon makes two life-changing discoveries: one, his grandmother was really a witch from another world, and two, said other world is just on the other side of her closet door! Thanks to a book she left for Shiro, he also manages to obtain an all-powerful skill called \"Equivalent Exchange,\" which allows him to turn money from his world into otherworldly currency and vice versa.\n\nWith this, Shiro decides to set up shop and sell convenient items like matches to the colorful inhabitants of the other world.
