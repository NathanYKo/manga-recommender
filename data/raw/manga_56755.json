    "synopsis": "Why are we here? Why are we doing this?\n\nBefore Haruhiro had realized what happened, he was surrounded by darkness. Why was he here? Where was here? Even now, he still didn't know. Those around him were the same as him, no one remembered anything other than their own names. And when they emerged from the darkness, the world that awaited them seemed like something out of a video game.\n\nIn order to survive, Haruhiro forms a party with the others, learns fighting skills, and as a soldier in the reserve force, takes his first steps into the world of Grimgar. What awaits him there, he doesn't know...\n\nThis is the story of an adventure born from the ashes.\n\n(Source: NanoDesu)",
