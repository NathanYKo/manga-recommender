But now that she is a first year student at Shoubi Academy, Anís considers it to be more of a curse than a blessing. She cannot remove it no matter how hard she tries, and due to its presence, she receives constant attention from the rest of the school.\n\nOne day, a bat-like creature appears out of nowhere and crashes into Anís' head. During its escape, an elegant red rose card is left behind and her choker goes missing. Reminded that a severe punishment awaits her should she ever take it off, Anís frantically begins to search for the lost item. This search leads her to learn that she is the Rose Princess, the sovereign of four Rose Knights: Kaede Higa, the offensive Red Rose; Mitsuru Tenjou, the defensive White Rose; Seiran Asagi, the alchemy-skilled Blue Rose, and Mutsuki Kurama, the discovery-centered Black Rose. They are all the most popular boys at her school, and with only a kiss to their respective cards, Anís can now summon their presence and magical abilities!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Taisuke Kanou is your average 16-year-old student. He has two close friends, Hirose and Megumi. Hirose has trouble with bullies, but Taisuke is always there to defend him, even though he just winds up getting beaten instead of Hirose. During class one day, Taisuke is hit by something unworldly and for that split second, he sees a vision of the universe. As he's walking home from school, he sees a girl fall and die in front of him, but his first thought is jealousy. He later finds out that the strange sensation that hit him is spreading throughout Japan. Those who are struck by it either commit suicide or \"evolve,\" but the comrades that evolve usually have dark intentions for the rest of the world.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "Famed horror manga artist Junji Itou loves nothing more than to stand and admire the fresh white wallpaper, gleaming floors, and smell of his brand-new house. But his happiness is short-lived when his fiancée, A-ko, reminds him of her plan to bring her cat Yon into their new abode. As an avid dog person, Junji experiences chills down his spine whenever he recalls Yon's uncanny face and a seeming skull on his furry coat. When A-ko also decides to adopt another cat, Muu, to keep Yon company, he fears that all hell will break loose.\n\nWith Yon and Muu's arrival, the wallpaper is quickly covered in shiny, protective sheets; the floor is marred with scratches; and the stench of the litter box hangs heavy in the air. The two cats become quick friends, and—to Junji's surprise—endear themselves to the new cat owner as well. As they grow closer, the manga artist begins to believe that living with cats may not be so bad after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But after one disastrous attempt, they began relying on food from convenience stores instead. While flower-viewing, Kouhei and Tsumugi run into Kotori Iida, one of Kouhei's socially awkward students. Once she spots Tsumugi trying to take a bite out of her lunch, Kotori invites them to her mother's restaurant.\n\nIn an attempt to feed Tsumugi something delicious, Kouhei barges into the restaurant in the middle of the night—only to find Kotori waiting for them and willing to help him in the kitchen. Although Kotori is as helpless as Kouhei when it comes to cooking, the two manage to make a simple dish. It turns out that, due to her mom's job, Kotori has been eating dinner alone for a long time. For the sake of Tsumugi's happiness, Kouhei promises her and Kotori that they will all eat together—thus marking the first of many sweet moments while sharing meals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Dedicated Huntsmen and Huntresses battle Grimm with both customized weapons and their own Semblances, unique abilities derived from the energy of one's soul. Some warriors also utilize a crystallized energy propellant, Dust, to bestow their weapons with elemental properties. In this dangerous line of work, rigorous training is required to stay alive. To that end, each of Remnant's four Kingdoms have established schools to properly groom children holding aspirations of becoming licensed Huntsmen.\n\nAt Beacon Academy in the Kingdom of Vale, a promising group of future Huntresses make their debut as Team RWBY. Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long each come from different backgrounds and often butt heads as a result. However, when they cooperate, they are a formidable force who have even attracted the attention of Beacon's headmaster Professor Ozpin. Alongside fellow students such as those in Team JNPR, the young prodigy Ruby and her friends engage in adventures that pit them against an extremist Faunus group known as the White Fang. Every explosive encounter also brings them closer to the true villains orchestrating conflicts from the shadows.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite busy work schedules and their age difference, their love for each other never wavers.\n\nBe it frisky fights over who ate the last pudding or serious conversations about their future together, Yuuya and Rio still find themselves nervous and bashful around each other, reminiscent of the early days of their relationship. Yet their adorable everyday dynamic is nothing short of the joy and giddiness of a couple's true love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, he despises the Akagami way of life and vows to rescind the infamy of his family by staying celibate. But as fate would have it, Akemitsu falls in love at first sight on his way home from work one day. Unable to erase his feelings that are spiraling out of control, he resorts to his final measure—to practice as a monk and seal away his worldly desires.\n\nHoping to put his past behind him, Akemitsu travels to the nearest temple in order to receive Buddhist training. But fate tempts him once again: greeting him at the door is the girl he had fallen madly in love with, who lives in the very temple he wishes to train in.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Publicly challenging his father to a revenge bout for the title of \"World's Strongest,\" Baki sets out to train himself even further. He targets the few men who are said to hold comparable power to Yuujirou, including the \"Unchained\" bounty hunter Biscuit Olivia and a prehistoric human named Pickle revived from the Mesozoic era.\n\nThe demonic Yuujirou monitors his son's training with a growing anticipation. The \"Ogre\" sees Baki as little more than a savory meal marinating for him to devour. Still, Yuujirou exists in solitude at the top of the mountain of strength. He yearns for a combatant to rise up and prove themselves a worthy opponent capable of giving him a challenge. Despite viewing his son as pathetic, Yuujirou can't help but hope his child will be the one to give him the thrill of equal combat he has lived so long without.\n\nAs Baki seeks to understand his father's monstrous legacy, Yuujirou comes to terms with his true feelings toward his son. The two Hanmas advance toward their climactic fight to decide who is really the \"World's Strongest.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Blessed with great fortune since his childhood, he grew up wanting nothing but affection from his oftentimes distant family.\n\nAfter losing his mother and crippling his dominant arm in an accident, Tamahiko fell into deep despair and was cast aside by his own father for his handicap. Condemned to live isolated in the countryside where he would not bring shame to his family's name, he resigned himself to dying alone—until one day, a young girl named Yuzuki Tachibana appeared on his doorstep, proclaiming that Tamahiko's father sent her to be his bride.\n\nAs she takes care of Tamahiko, Yuzuki brings a feeling of springtime into Tamahiko's dreary life, allowing him to gradually heal from the deep emotional scars of his youth. Their lives slowly intertwine as both Tamahiko and Yuzuki taste the fruits of their first love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After his untimely death, Kazuma finds himself standing before Aqua—the self-proclaimed water goddess who presents him two with choices: to ascend to heaven or reincarnate in a real fantasy world. Picking the latter, Kazuma gets tasked with defeating the Demon King, an occurring threat in his new world. However, Aqua's provocative attitude strikes a nerve, and in the heat of the moment, Kazuma takes her along.\n\nKazuma and Aqua, now stuck together in another world, embark on a journey. They soon acquire two more companions: Megumin, an archwizard wielding devastating explosion magic; and Lalatina \"Darkness\" Dustiness Ford, a crusader with a worrisome case of masochism. The four of them form an odd party, each member contributing their unique share of power and a peculiar personality. Unfortunately, their adventure soon proves to be challenging and costly, Kazuma's new life may be nothing but a headache.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Up until now, his only insight into urban affairs was through an anonymous online group chat, where he found out about Ikebukuro's renowned legend. It says that a headless biker known only as the \"Black Rider\" roams Ikebukuro, executing its own justice against criminals.\n\nBut the district's quirks do not end there; Ikebukuro is swarming with so-called color gangs and their ceaseless conflicts. Among them, a colorless gang known as the Dollars is most noteworthy, as its founder, members, and numbers are all unknown. With odd cliques at every turn and uncanny tales coming to life, humans seem to mix with the supernatural, and Mikado soon dives into the deep sea of Ikebukuro's myths, deceits, and carefully planned out crises—a dangerous world, but possibly one where he belongs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the present day, the emperor and his four sons reign over the country with an iron fist. It is said that only the prophesied \"Child of Destiny\" can free Japan from the royal family's shackles.\n\nSarasa is the twin sister of Tatara, the Child of Destiny. Despite having to live in her brother's shadow, Sarasa supports him in any way she can. However, tragedy strikes when the Red King, the emperor's youngest son, and his army attack her village, leading to Tatara's brutal death. To protect the townspeople, Sarasa takes on her brother's name and becomes the Child of Destiny, vowing revenge on the Red King.\n\nWith the sudden turn of events taking a toll on her health, Sarasa visits a hot spring to recuperate. During her stay, she meets Shuri, a charming yet mysterious young man. Shuri is fascinated by Sarasa as she treats him differently from other girls; meanwhile, Sarasa is unable to stop thinking about him. This casual encounter between the two seals their fate—destined to be bound by war, hatred, and love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
