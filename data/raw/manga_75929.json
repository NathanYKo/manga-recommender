    "synopsis": "It is early 16th-century Italy, and the city of Florence blossoms amid wondrous depictions of the newly-birthed Renaissance. Men are opening their art workshops, displaying their craft, and taking on aspiring artists as apprentices. Meanwhile, women are expected to serve their husbands and raise their children.\n\nArte, a young girl from a noble family, is deeply passionate about painting. Following her supportive father's death, her mother resolves to mold Arte into a proper virtuous lady, considering their moderate dowry. But Arte is spirited and daring, determined to relinquish gender norms and become a full-fledged artist.\n\nArte tirelessly seeks an artisan to take her in, but all doors close before a foolish woman. However, one small workshop owner, Leo, gives her a chance. When Arte proves her perseverance and devotion to art, Leo decides to house her as his only apprentice. Truly free for the first time, Arte is set on securing her place in the male-dominated art world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
