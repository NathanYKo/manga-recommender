    "synopsis": "Yuan Ge, a director at an advertising firm, is interrupted in the midst of a meeting with the news that his long-estranged wife has passed away. He barely finds time to grieve for her, a woman he had long since ceased to love. Several days later, he is struck by the vision of a young girl on a subway bus, but she disappears the minute he looks away.\n\nThis is a story of lost love, and of one man's personal journey.\n\n(Source: Easy Going Scans)",
