    "synopsis": "Rena Rubel has felt isolated throughout her childhood as she was raised alone, away from her parents, the marquis of the north and his wife. Rena's life begins to change for the better when they welcome her back with open arms. Yet, on the day before her 12th birthday, Rena is betrayed by her father as she is sold off to a mysterious man and is forced to become an offering.\n\nYears later, while heading to the capital, Lin saves two women—Rena and her maid Yuni—who were being cornered by a group of criminals. After inviting them to a meal, Lin is surprised to learn that Rena is not just a pretty face; she is far stronger and more dangerous than she presents herself to be.\n\nThe innocent little girl is no more—Rena has returned to find her father and decide if he is worthy of her forgiveness. If he proves to be the same greedy scoundrel who discarded his own flesh and blood, Rena is going to make sure he suffers the same hell she went through.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
