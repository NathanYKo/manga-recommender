Despite concealing her true identity, it does not take long for Kanna to adjust to human society—becoming an elementary school student and quickly befriending her fellow classmates. With an eager interest to learn and experience more of the modern world, Kanna's daily life is bound to be rich with fun and excitement.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
