    "synopsis": "Sanada North High School is home to three ordinary boys—Tadakuni, Hidenori Tabata, and Yoshitake Tanaka—who get into ordinary situations that any high school boy could find himself in. Rather than fretting over relationships or aiming for the national championships, the trio finds themselves trying on skirts, maximizing their summer vacation, and musing with a hopeless romantic by the riverside. The constant clash of their conflicting personalities sparks various events that depict the absurd yet relatable daily lives of high school boys.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
