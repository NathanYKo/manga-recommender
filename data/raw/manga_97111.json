    "synopsis": "College student Suzuhara lives in an extremely shabby apartment. The rent is cheap, and he can deal with most of the issues with his living space—with the exception of the extremely thin walls. Every night, Suzuhara is kept awake by the loud women his neighbor, Nishino, brings over for sex. At some point, the ridiculous, over-the-top moaning becomes too much for the sleep-deprived Suzuhara to handle, so he makes an equally loud and annoying request for the pair to pipe down. Soon after, his doorbell rings and a frustrated Nishino complains that his incessant banging on the walls scared his girl away. In exchange for this inconvenience, Nishino insists that Suzuhara take her place—a demand he swiftly refuses.\n\nSuddenly, however, Suzuhara's personal life gets much more complicated. Being a closeted gay man, he has been in love with his straight best friend, Nakayama, for years. So when this unrequited love of his begs Suzuhara to let him borrow the apartment for a night with his girlfriend—he agrees, even as his feelings hit rock bottom. But then, when Nishino sees him pathetically kicked out of his own room, Suzuhara decides to fulfill his outstanding debt and agrees to have sex with his neighbor. He does this with his own selfish intentions in mind, knowing that just next door, on the other side of the building's very thin walls, the man he loves is fulfilling his own sexual desires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot: Hi-manual Renai",
