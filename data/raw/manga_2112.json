As her father would not approve, she does modeling secretly with the help of her Uncle. \n\nAhjin has a crush on Dohoon, one of the coolest guys in school, and when Ahjin (dressed up as Jinny) finds out that she'll be living in the same building as her crush, she's thrilled! But how can she keep her secret from Dohoon, when he insists on pursuing the model Jinny?!",
