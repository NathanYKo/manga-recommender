    "synopsis": "Souta Matsubayashi is seen by his classmates as a gruff delinquent; in contrast, Sakura Miyazen is viewed as a beautiful princess. From their appearances, it may seem like they have nothing in common. However, with the polar opposites beginning the school year in the same class, the two both want to get closer to each other, but their nerves get in the way when trying to start conversations.\n\nOne thing they mutually share is their love for yakuza movies. Miyazen tries to get through to Matsubayashi by referencing these films, yet Matsubayashi misinterprets her intentions in the most embarrassing of ways instead. As the two awkward teens stumble their way through every conversation, a blossoming friendship seems more probable than ever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
