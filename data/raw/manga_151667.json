For Hanjun Park, a high schooler beaten down to the ground in an alley, the answer has been set in stone for a while: be true to his heart once more, unleash those simmering knuckles, and beat the sh*t out of anyone standing on his way to his revenge. Suit, make it rain. It’s time to wash away some bad blood.\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
