    "synopsis": "After being cancelled on social media, Sekai Kuzuno falls into despair and wishes so hard to leave his life behind that he suddenly finds himself in a fantasy RPG world. He has nothing but the clothes on his back...and his handy game controller. With a press of the pause button, he becomes a literal Time Stop Hero. Running off with money, one-shotting static mobs, and flipping the skirts of every girl in sight, Sekai's desires are boundless, but his power isn't! If he doesn't clear the game in three days, time will stop for Sekai—forever!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
