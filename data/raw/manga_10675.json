    "synopsis": "During the Meiji period, this story centers around an unsuccessful science fiction author who masquerades as the dead son of an industrial magnate. With his new family's riches, he creates a fantastical island to satisfy his desires.\n\nIn his manga adaptation of The Strange Tale of Panorama Island (panorama-tou kidan), Maruo strays from his usual style of explicit gore while maintaining his trademark: elaborate, elegant art.\nSprawling, overwhelming landscapes, a diverse range of uniquely designed characters, and even scenes distorted grotesquely for effect are captured with ease by the talented and experienced mangaka.\n\n(Source: MU)",
