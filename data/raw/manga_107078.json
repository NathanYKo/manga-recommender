    "synopsis": "High school can be a stressful time for many teenagers, and as such, a lot of them take up hobbies to help them cope with the trials of everyday life. But for sophomore Zen Minedara, his stress-relieving hobby—taking upskirt photos of the girls around him—could land him in jail.\n\nZen knows it's wrong, but he can't stop. In his mind, nothing else can bring him relief. However, when he snaps an upskirt photo of the beautiful class vice president Ayame Houjou on the way to the station, she catches him and threatens to report him to the station master. Zen pleads for mercy, promising to do whatever she wants. Surprisingly, Ayame agrees to those terms, and Zen breathes a sigh of relief, unaware of the strange fate he has bound himself to.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
