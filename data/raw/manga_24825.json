But as soon as she arrives, every man in the city, including the king, falls madly in love with her. She is about to be forced into marriage, but is saved by a sorcerer. The sorcerer identifies himself as Shion, one of the youngest and most talented in the nation. They have met before, but Emma has no recollection.\n\nShion explains to Emma that she is cursed with the Echidna, a mysterious magic that appears every 500 years where a girl is born with her heart packed with such powerful dark magic that it has the potential to destroy the world. With such power, one could rule the world, and Shion explains to Emma that people are going to try and hunt her down to get her heart. However, Emma is told that there exists a ritual that will rid her of the Echidna's curse but doing so will require a long and arduous process. The first of that being Emma and Shion will have to marry each other...\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 8: Karakuri Link",
