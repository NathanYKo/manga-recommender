        "synopsis": "Kenzou Tenma, a renowned Japanese neurosurgeon working in post-war Germany, faces a difficult choice: to operate on Johan Liebert, an orphan boy on the verge of death, or on the mayor of Düsseldorf. In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead.\n\nAs a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings.\n\nSetting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 14: Berserk: The Prototype",

        "synopsis": "As the 20th century approaches its end, people all over the world are anxious that the world is changing. And probably not for the better.\n\nKenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop.\n\nKenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "At the tender age of 12, Mitsuki Kouyama has a sarcoma in her throat. Though this rare cancer can be cured by removing her vocal cords, Mitsuki refuses because of her desire to become a pop singer and keep her childhood promise to Eichi Sakurai, her first love who left for America. Unable to both heal and keep her voice, she allows her health to deteriorate, as she accepts her tragic fate.\n\nOne day, while escaping the home of her music-hating grandmother to attend an audition, Mitsuki meets two shinigami, Takuto Kira and Meroko Yui. Realizing that Mitsuki can see them, Takuto and Meroko reveal to her that she will die in a year. Moved by her plight, Takuto allows Mitsuki the chance to pursue her dream by giving her the ability to transform into a healthy sixteen-year-old girl. After being chosen for a contract with Seed Records, Mitsuki makes her debut under the stage name Full Moon and chooses to pursue her dream music career before her life's end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Ginyuu Meika",

When a mysterious man attempts to monopolize Sakura's ability, her memories scatter throughout different worlds in the form of feathers. To save Sakura, Syaoran seeks help from the Dimensional Witch and meets two other travelers—Kurogane and Fai D. Flourite.\n\nKurogane, a capable fighter and ninja, has been banished from his homeworld and wishes to return. In contrast, Fai, a magician from Celes, wants to traverse different worlds to avoid his home and past. As the price to cross dimensions, each of the three must sacrifice their most valued possession. For Sakura's sake, Syaoran agrees to give away their relationship as payment to the Dimensional Witch. With firm determination, Syaoran, Kurogane, and Fai begin journeying through numerous worlds to fight against their ill-fated destinies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn't because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him. Prior to Naruto's birth, the powerful and deadly Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village. In order to stop the rampage, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the body of the newborn Naruto.\n\nAnd so when he is assigned to Team 7—along with his new teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the mentorship of veteran ninja Kakashi Hatake—Naruto is forced to work together with other people for the first time in his life. Through undergoing vigorous training and taking on challenging missions, Naruto must learn what it means to work in a team and carve his own route toward becoming a full-fledged ninja recognized by his village.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Naruto has sold over 250 million copies worldwide as of 2020, making it the 4th highest-grossing manga series of all time. It was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2014, and in the same year, Masashi Kishimoto was awarded Rookie of the Year in the media fine arts category by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs. The series was published in English by VIZ Media under the Shonen Jump imprint from August 16, 2003, to October 6, 2015. In the last four months of 2007, the campaign titled Naruto Nation was launched, in which three volumes were published each month so that US releases would be closer to Japan's. The same practice was done in February through April of 2009, this time titled Generation Ninja. A 3-in-1 omnibus edition was later released. A box set containing volumes 1 through 27 was released on August 6, 2008, a set containing volumes 28 through 48 on July 7, 2015, and the final box set with volumes 49 through 72 on January 5, 2016. It was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Panini Comics from May 2007 to June 2015; in German by Carlsen Verlag; and in French and Dutch by Kana. Numerous databooks, artbooks, novels, and fanbooks on the series have been released. Eight summary volumes featuring unaltered color pages, larger dimensions, and exclusive interviews, covering the first part of the series were released between November 7, 2008, and April 10, 2009.",

One day, Ichigo returns home to find an intruder in his room who introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper tasked with helping souls pass over. Suddenly, the two are jolted from their conversation when a Hollow—an evil spirit known for consuming souls—attacks. As Ichigo makes a brash attempt to stop the Hollow, Rukia steps in and shields him from a counterattack. Injured and unable to keep fighting, Rukia suggests a risky plan—transfer half of her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo. He accepts and, to Rukia's surprise, ends up absorbing her powers entirely, allowing him to easily dispatch the Hollow.\n\nNow a Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo must take up Rukia's duties of exterminating Hollows and protecting spirits, both living and dead. Along with his friends Orihime Inoue and Yasutora Sado—who later discover spiritual abilities of their own—Ichigo soon learns that the consequences of becoming a Soul Reaper and dealing with the world of spirits are far greater than he ever imagined.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But just before his demise, he confirms the existence of a great treasure, One Piece, located somewhere within the vast ocean known as the Grand Line.

This war resulted in an explosion known as \"Overdrive\"—a blast so powerful that it sent the Dark Bring into a deep slumber and scattered the pieces of Rave across the world.\n\nIn the present, Haru Glory lives a peaceful life on Garage Island until one day, he catches the creature Plue while fishing. Plue is later recognized by Shiba Roses, an old man who happens to be the original Rave Master. Shiba explains that the Dark Bring has resurfaced, and that to stop it, assembling the scattered parts of Rave is of utmost urgency. However, before Shiba can leave on this mission, he is attacked by a soldier from the evil organization Demon Card, forcing him to transfer the power of Rave to Haru. With the fate of humankind resting on his shoulders, the new Rave Master begins his quest to find the scattered Rave fragments.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Negi Springfield, a 10-year-old wizard who recently graduated from Merdiana Magic Academy in Wales, hopes to achieve two things—to find his missing father, who was once known as the Thousand Master, and to become a Magister Magi, someone who helps the everyday world through magic. To reach his latter goal, he is assigned one last task: to teach English at a middle school in Japan.\n\nMuch to his surprise and dismay, he not only discovers that his homeroom class consists of 31 girls, but also ends up revealing his true identity as a magician to Asuna Kagurazaka, one of his new students. Negi must now negotiate with the girl and face his most difficult challenge yet—to keep his identity a secret as he tackles magical threats both from within and outside of Mahora Academy, all the while keeping a watchful eye out for his lost father.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "It is said that if a couple gets into the University of Tokyo together, they will live happily ever after. However, for Keitarou Urashima, UTokyo is a distant dream. After failing the entrance exams twice already, he decides to stay at his grandmother's inn in Tokyo in order to prepare for his third attempt. He is, therefore, surprised when he finds out that not only has his grandmother gone on a long vacation, but the inn has also become the Hinata House, an all-girls dormitory!\n\nUnfortunately for Keitarou, a series of misunderstandings during his first visit leave him with five untrusting tenants. But when Haruka Urashima, his aunt who works at the dorm, brings up that he is supposedly a UTokyo student, the girls' impressions of him quickly change, and they reluctantly allow him to stay. Feeling guilty about the lie, he slowly gets to know his new neighbors: the cute yet violent Naru Narusegawa, the cheeky and opportunistic Mitsune Konno, the soft-spoken Shinobu Maehara, the straight-laced Motoko Aoyama, and the mischievous Kaolla Su.\n\nThus continues the unpopular Keitarou's difficult journey to get into UTokyo, all for the chance to fulfill his childhood promise to the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him and maybe, just maybe, meet her again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It's all an act of deception; she is really the self-confessed 'queen of vanity,' and her only goal in life is winning the praise and admiration of everyone around her.\n\nWhen she enters high school, she finally meets her match: Souichirou Arima, a handsome, athletic, popular, and very intelligent young boy. Ever since he stole the top seat in the class from her, Yukino has hated him, and has been plotting on how to take back her former place as the object of all other students' admiration.\n\nWhat she wasn't expecting, however, was that Souichirou, the very boy she hated, would confess his love for her. Or that he would find out about her deception—and use it to blackmail her!\n\nTogether, they discover that they have more in common than they knew, and they slowly begin to bring out each other's inner selves.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Tora to Chameleon: Yakusoku wa Isshukan (The Tiger and the Chameleon: A Promise for One Week)\nVolume 4: Ashita Mata Mori de Aou ne (Meet Me Again Tomorrow in the Forest)\nVolume 8: Abareru Ousama (The Raging King)",

        "synopsis": "When Hikaru Shindou discovers an old go board in his grandfather's attic, he is greeted by the spirit of an ancient go master, Fujiwara no Sai. Sai spent his life teaching the techniques of the board game to an emperor during the Heian era, and now in his ghostly state, he is eager to share his passion with the unsuspecting Hikaru. The only problem is that Hikaru is not all that interested in board games. But Sai is not easily dissuaded. Pressured by Sai's unrelenting desire to pursue something he refers to as the \"Divine Move,\" Hikaru begrudgingly consents to playing the game, executing moves as dictated by Sai. But slowly, intrigued by the dedication of his peers, he begins to learn the basics of the game.\n\nAs Hikaru enters into the world of go, guided by his intangible tutor and inspired by his rival, Akira Touya, he cannot help but be drawn into the complex game as he grows determined to prove his own abilities. In a coming-of-age story centering around an ancient board game, Hikaru no Go tells the story of a boy maturing through the pursuit of his newfound passion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Inside the notebook, he finds a chilling message: those whose names are written in it shall die. Its nonsensical nature amuses Light; but when he tests its power by writing the name of a criminal in it, they suddenly meet their demise.\n\nRealizing the Death Note's vast potential, Light commences a series of nefarious murders under the pseudonym \"Kira,\" vowing to cleanse the world of corrupt individuals and create a perfect society where crime ceases to exist. However, the police quickly catch on, and they enlist the help of L—a mastermind detective—to uncover the culprit.\n\nDeath Note tells the thrilling tale of Light and L as they clash in a great battle-of-minds, one that will determine the future of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Ten years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money.\n\nOne wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past.\n\nNow in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 28: Meteor Strike",

One day, the sisters' lives are turned upside down when their father announces that he has promised one of them to be married to a fellow martial artist's son in hopes of carrying on the family legacy. In addition to their mixed reactions, when the fiancé arrives, the last thing the Tendou family expects is Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma.\n\nRanma has been training in China with his father until an unfortunate accident changed them both. Now, when water touches them, Ranma turns into a girl and Genma into a giant panda. Ranma ½ follows Ranma as he attempts to get along with his newly betrothed, the youngest of the Tendou sisters, Akane. As the two begin to attend the same school, they deal with fellow friends and rivals, all of whom have something to say about their engagement.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as \"Akuma.\" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of \"Innocence,\" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. \n\nTo prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Alchemists are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor.\n\nYears later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Six years ago, Kamui Shirou and siblings Fuuma and Kotori Monou were inseparable childhood friends. After the sudden, gruesome death of the Monou siblings' mother, Kamui was taken away from Tokyo by his own mother. In the years that passed, the two lived peacefully while Kamui strengthened his innate telekinetic abilities. When his mother passes away in 1999, her dying wish prompts him to return to Tokyo to face his \"destiny.\"\n\nWhen Kamui reappears in the city, his attitude has taken a drastic turn, and he displays the growth of his powers through violent confrontations in the streets. Various opponents come after him asking if he is \"Kamui,\" but they seem to be demanding something far more significant than his name. These fighters represent two opposite factions—the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth—who each wish to recruit him to their cause. Piecing together clues about the apocalyptic \"promised day,\" Kamui realizes that he holds the fate of the world in his hands. Depending on which group of Dragons he allies himself with, he can either choose to save the world—or end it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "X is written and illustrated by the four-person team of CLAMP. It is currently incomplete, but CLAMP has stated their intention to one day conclude the series if they can. It started serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka shoujo manga magazine in May 1992 and stopped serialization in March 2003. Events depicted in the manga were too similar for comfort to real-life disasters that occurred in Japan, which contributed to the series' halt. Chapters of X have been collected in eighteen and a \"half\" volumes, out of a total twenty-one volumes expected. X has been adapted into various anime that speculate about events that occurred before the manga started or after the point where the manga left off. The series was published in English by VIZ Media as 3-in-1 omnibus volume from November 8, 2011 to August 13, 2013.",

Despite continually facing failure in her quest for love, her spirits have never dampened. At the age of 20, she finds herself on a train to Tokyo with hopes of reuniting with her current boyfriend.\n\nNana Osaki, on the other hand, is feisty and prideful. After joining a local band during her high school days, she falls in love with music and one of the band members. However, when faced with the choice between her relationship and her musical career, she chooses the latter and separates from her boyfriend. On her 20th birthday, she boards the same train to Tokyo, like her namesake, where she aims to become a top vocalist.\n\nThe two girls with the same name but very different aspirations find themselves sitting together on their journey to the city, and, as fate would have it, eventually share the same apartment. A deep and unique bond is then forged, where they will support each other in this saga of love, music, friendship, and heartbreak.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She soon awakens to find herself surrounded by even more strangely dressed people in the basement studio of Paradise Kiss—a fashion design club composed of four students from Yazawa School for the Arts. Although it seems like Yukari has been kidnapped, the older students explain that they only approached her to see if she would model their collection for an upcoming fashion show.\n\nBeing a senior with a busy schedule, Yukari furiously rejects the group's offer. But when she drops her student passbook in her haste to leave, the ringleader of the group, George Koizumi, picks it up and uses it as a means to coerce Yukari into considering their request. After hearing about the other members' unbridled ambition, Yukari is inspired to reevaluate her own circumstances and eventually agrees to help them out.\n\nNow as Paradise Kiss' model, Yukari must learn to balance her new responsibilities with her hectic personal life. However, the more time she spends with George and the rest of the team, the harder it becomes for her to avoid getting swept up in the glitz and glamor of the fashion world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "At Ouran High School, an academy where only the children of the rich and powerful attend, there exists a club consisting of the most elite of the student body: the legendary Host Club. Within the club's room, six beautiful, bored boys spend their time entertaining equally beautiful and bored girls.\n\nHaruhi Fujioka, a poor scholarship student, has no interest in the Host Club—until she breaks a valuable vase in their clubroom. After being mistaken for a boy, Haruhi is forced by Kyouya Ootori to work for the Host Club to repay her debt. Tamaki Suou, the princely leader of the club, eagerly takes her under his wing to teach her the ways of the host.\n\nThings, however, are never quite so simple with the Host Club around. Even the most mundane events can turn into huge spectacles with the likes of prankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, stoic Takashi Morinozuka, and sweet Mitsukuni \"Hunny\" Haninozuka. The crazy adventures of the Host Club are just beginning, and Haruhi must learn how to survive in the glitzy world of the hosts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: The final volume contains a special bonus chapter where the group travels to Spain.",

After all, she also has feelings for his friend. Unluckily, however, their respective crushes fall for each other instead. Determined to find new love after their recent misfortunes, the pair decide to cheer each other on while maintaining their usual dynamic of constant bickering. \n\nAlthough they continually deny it, Risa and Ootani are more similar than they like to admit: they both have unusual heights, failing grades, identical tastes in food, and a tendency to act extremely childish. Together, they inspire laughter among their peers as a so-called comedic duo. Could the love that these two are looking for be closer than they think?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 12: Hoshi ni Nattemo Aishiteru\nVolume 16: Bokura no Ibasho",

        "synopsis": "In the not too distant future, mankind battles over O-Parts, relics from an ancient civilization. It takes a special kind of person to unlock the full potential of these remnants from the past, and a unique breed of humans known as O.P.T.s (or O-Parts Tacticians) become a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, O-Parts can be used for good or evil purposes.\n\nJio is a young boy with a tragic past who only trusts one thing in the world: money. Little does he suspect that he is actually a very powerful O.P.T., and inside him sleeps a demon of incredible ferocity. He meets up with a girl named Ruby, and together they decide to embark on a dangerous quest to discover as many O-Parts as they can. Will Jio help Ruby realize her dream of becoming a world famous treasure hunter? More importantly, will Ruby help Jio realize his dream of--world domination?!\n\n(Source: Viz Media)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 6: Trigger",

As she does not have any friends and performs poorly at school, her mean-spirited aunt resents having to take care of her. Wholeheartedly believing that God will grant her salvation one day, she tightly holds onto the ring that her mother passed down to her.\n\nSeeking solace by spending time at her late cat's grave, Karin unexpectedly meets a boy named Kazune Kuujou, who claims he is looking for God. However, Kazune calls her weak for relying on her deceased cat for comfort. Angered by the insult, Karin subconsciously channels energy into her mother's ring. Soon enough, she begins to excel at school and classmates compliment her for the first time. Unbeknownst to her, the ring has bestowed her godly powers.\n\nThe revelation of the ring's transcendent strength catches the eyes of not only Kazune but also more sinister figures who wish to take advantage of Karin for nefarious purposes. Karin must now use her newly acquired gift to fight back against these malicious forces, unaware of the truth behind her heritage and the existence of others with similar abilities.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her real identity is Maron Kusakabe, a 16-year-old rhythmic gymnastics enthusiast and student at Momokuri Academy— something unknown to all, even her best friend Miyako Toudaiji, who is in charge of the police chase for Jeanne.\n\nHidden inside the paintings Maron steals are demons sent by the demon lord, who plans to weaken God's power by having his minions possess human hearts. Assisted by the minor angel Finn Fish, it is up to Maron as the reincarnation of Jeanne d'Arc to assume her alter ego, hunt down the cursed paintings, and seal the vile demons away. However, the tough job of balancing this duty with her lonesome high school life only proves more challenging when a mysterious new phantom thief makes his appearance—Kaitou Sinbad.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Depending on your family's wealth and your individual merit, you can be classified as a Silver or Bronze student. However, there is only one Gold student, and this year that person is Shizumasa Touguu—nicknamed \"the Emperor\" because he is the Student Council President.\n\nWhen she was very young, Haine Otomiya fell in love with Shizumasa, after reading the children's picture book that he authored. She had met him twice before attending Imperial Academy, but as a Bronze student, her rank is far below his, so she has been unable to approach him at school. \n\nHaine jumps at an opportunity to get close to Shizumasa, and she unexpectedly becomes his bodyguard as well as a member of the Student Council. It seems like a dream come true for her, but soon she will learn that everyone in the Student Council is hiding secrets, and her own shameful history cannot be forgotten either.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shots",

The next morning, however, Kazuki is left wondering whether it was all a dream. Lo and behold, the girl, the monster, and his death are all real! The girl, Tokiko Tsumura, was actually trying to slay the homunculus (a beast that can take the form of humans, but whose main source of food is people), but Kazuki got in her way. To revive Kazuki, Tokiko replaces his heart with a \"kakugane,\" an alchemic device that allows him to summon a lance with which to fight the monsters. It turns out that Tokiko is a member of Renkin Kenshi (Alchemist Soldiers)—an organization sworn to protect the world from the diabolical creatures. Soon, Kazuki joins Tokiko in her quest to terminate the sinister being that creates and controls the homunculus.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 10: Embalming: Dead Body and Bride",

        "synopsis": "Bulma, a headstrong 16-year-old girl, is on a quest to find the mythical Dragon Balls—seven scattered magic orbs that grant the finder a single wish. She has but one desire in mind: a perfect boyfriend. On her journey, Bulma stumbles upon Gokuu Son, a powerful orphan who has only ever known one human besides her. Gokuu possesses one of the Dragon Balls, it being a memento from his late grandfather. In exchange for it, Bulma invites Gokuu to be a companion in her travels.\n\nBy Bulma's side, Gokuu discovers a world completely alien to him. Powerful enemies embark on their own pursuits of the Dragon Balls, pushing Gokuu beyond his limits in order to protect Bulma and their growing circle of allies. However, Gokuu has secrets unbeknownst to even himself; the incredible strength within him stems from a mysterious source, one that threatens the many people he grows to hold dear.\n\nAs his prowess in martial arts flourishes, Gokuu attracts stronger opponents whose villainous plans could collapse beneath his might. He undertakes the endless venture of combat training to defend his loved ones and the fate of the planet itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time. With over 260 million copies sold worldwide, the series is the fourth best-selling manga of all time as of 2024. It is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump,\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. The series was serialized in English by VIZ Media in a monthly comic book anthology format from March 1998 to March 2005. The publisher later collected the series into traditional tankoubon volumes from March 12, 2003, to June 6, 2006. To closely follow the English anime localization, the series was split, with volumes 17 through 42 titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1 through 26. Other releases by VIZ Media include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover-based 3-in-1 edition, and a full-color edition of chapters 195 through 245. The series was also published in Spanish by Planet DeAgostini Cómics; in German and Danish by Carlsen Verlag; and in French and Dutch by Glénat Editions.",

Despite the samurai's attempts to combat the extraterrestrial menace, the Shogun soon realizes that their efforts are futile and decides to surrender.

Now that his kind is no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet. Joined by his self-proclaimed disciple Shinpachi Shimura, the fearsome alien Kagura, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, they run the business known as Yorozuya, often getting caught up in all sorts of crazy and hilarious shenanigans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Dandelion\nVolume 2: Shirokuro (Black and White)\nVolume 24: 13\nVolume 38: Bankara-san ga Tooru",

Suspecting the girl is his classmate Aya Toujou, Junpei sets out to get in touch with her to refilm that skirt flip for \"artistic\" reasons. However, when he bumps into her the next day, he sees a girl that looks vastly different from the one in his memories.\n\nJust when Junpei thinks he is back to the drawing board, he runs into the school's darling, Tsukasa Nishino, boldly declaring that she is wearing strawberry panties for the day. Convincing himself that Tsukasa is the girl he has been looking for all along, Junpei starts planning his confession—all for the sake of becoming her boyfriend and filming her panties!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But despite his intimidating presence, he is secretly in love with the sweet and beautiful Rina Kurimi. Unfortunately, Randou is involved in a horrific bus accident, which leaves him comatose and with a disfigured face. A year later, he awakes to discover something utterly shocking—his face now resembles Rina's!\n\nRandou learns that he has been under the care of a surgeon named Jun Manabe, who reconstructed Randou's face based on a picture he had of Rina. Moreover, Randou is presumed dead, and his parents have moved away as a result. Distraught, Randou crosses paths with Rina and is mistaken for her twin sister Yuna, who fled from her house two years ago. Although Randou initially wished to restore his face, seeing Rina elated makes him reconsider his decision.\n\nHowever, a boy disguising himself as a girl is as absurd as it sounds, and being surrounded by troublesome individuals only makes it more difficult. Nevertheless, Randou is adamant about concealing his identity until he finds the real Yuna.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Freshman tennis prodigy Ryouma Echizen enrolls in the prestigious institution with his eyes set on claiming a regular position on the Boys' Tennis Team. As the son of legendary tennis player Samurai Nanjirou, Ryouma is sick of living in his shadow and wishes to surpass him someday. He is confident in his skills and has the cocky attitude to match. His teammates, however, are reluctant to accept him into their starting lineup, as he hasn't proven himself worthy of the spot.\n\nSeishun's ultimate goal is to make it to the National Tournament by the end of the year, but they first have to make it through the Kanto Regionals to even qualify for a spot in it. With their new \"super rookie\" on the team, Seishun is ready to take on anything that comes their way. With a varied assortment of rivals and opponents that can threaten their chance at the title, the Seishun team needs to give it their all in order to rise to the top.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 5: Tennis no Oujisama (pilot)",
        "background": "Tennis no Oujisama serialized in the Weekly Shounen Jump from July 1999 to March 2008. The series was put on hiatus in July 2006 after the writer, Takeshi Konomi, was injured in an accident; publication resumed in September 2006. The series was published in English as The Prince of Tennis by VIZ Media under the Shonen Jump imprint from April 21, 2004 to July 5, 2011. The manga has received multiple media adaptations. Since the Golden Week of 2003, Marvelous Entertainment has produced a series of musicals that are shown bi-annually, with each musical adapting one arc of the manga storyline. A live adaptation film was released in Japan on May 13, 2006, covering the storyline from when Ryoma arrives in Japan to the match against Hyotei Academy. Three Chinese dramas have been produced. Due to localization, the dramas feature different characters and cultural themes, but the story and characters' portrayal remain similar to the manga. A variety of video games based on the series, mostly tennis games or dating simulators, have been released in Japan across multiple consoles. A half-hour weekly radio show was also produced, featuring over 300 music CDs along with a large range of merchandise.",

        "synopsis": "Shamans are extraordinary individuals with the ability to communicate with ghosts, spirits, and gods, which are invisible to ordinary people. The Shaman Fight—a prestigious tournament pitting shamans from all over the world against each other—is held every five hundred years, where the winner is crowned Shaman King. This title allows the current incumbent to call upon the Great Spirit and shape the world as they see fit.\n \nFinding himself late for class one night, Manta Oyamada, an ordinary middle school student, decides to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. Noticing him, a lone boy sitting on a gravestone invites Manta to stargaze with \"them.\" Realizing that \"them\" refers to the boy and his ghostly friends, Manta flees in terror. Later, the boy introduces himself as You Asakura, a Shaman-in-training, and demonstrates his powers by teaming up with the ghost of six-hundred-year-old samurai Amidamaru to save Manta from a group of thugs. You befriends Manta due to his ability to see spirits, and with the help of Amidamaru, they set out to accomplish You's goal of becoming the next Shaman King.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: This entry is for the original printing of Shaman King.

However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: \"I hate basketball\" and \"I need a girlfriend.\"\n\nHaruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Slam Dunk won the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category in 1994. As of 2017, over 170 million copies of the series are in circulation. The manga's wide success led to a large increase in the popularity of basketball among Japanese youth. In 2010, Takehiko Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association for popularizing basketball in Japan. The series was published in English by Gutsoon! Entertainment under the Raijin Comics Imprint for five volumes from July 2, 2003, to May 5, 2004. After Gutsoon's shutdown, VIZ Media purchased the publishing rights and republished the series under the Shonen Jump imprint from September 2, 2008, to December 3, 2013. It was published in Spanish by Ivrea España from February 2003 to September 2005.",

Yuusuke regularly engages in street brawls against rival Kazuma Kuwabara and ridicules his childhood friend Keiko Yukimura. Filled with self-loathing and the burden of an alcoholic mother, Yuusuke sacrifices it all in a split-second decision—he tackles a small child out of the way of an oncoming car, losing his life in the process.\n\nSpirit guide Botan intervenes, allowing Yuusuke to see how the people in his life react to his death; he is moved by the emotional ruin his loss causes his mother, Keiko, and even Kuwabara. Additionally, due to his death's heroic nature, he receives an opportunity to return to life from the Spirit World ruler's son, Koenma.\n\nKoenma hires Yuusuke as a \"Spirit Detective\" and tasks him with solving a series of increasingly challenging paranormal mysteries. Battling and befriending demons such as the beautiful Kurama and hostile Hiei, Yuusuke further develops and utilizes his skills as a fighter. But as dark forces move in the Underworld, Yuusuke struggles alongside his companions to defend everything he took for granted.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "High school student Yuugi Mutou spends his days being bullied between classes and his nights playing board games and solving puzzles in his bedroom. Yuugi's penchant for gameplay comes from his grandfather, whose game shop also serves as a house for the two.\n\nOne night, Yuugi manages to solve the Millennium Puzzle, a seemingly impossible challenge that awakens his inner darkness and converts it into an alternate persona: Yami Yuugi. Transforming into the more bold and dangerous persona against his will in moments of great distress, Yuugi begins to moonlight as a vengeful vigilante, challenging bullies and evil-doers to risky games where failure results in fates worse than death.\n\nYuugi and his alter ego befriend some of the very students who once bullied him, forming unbreakable companionships with them. But the group must contend with villains far deadlier than the high school punks they originally rallied against, enemies who use games for nefarious purposes and threaten Yuugi and his friends' very lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, Kippei's family introduces him to his five-year-old cousin, Yuzuru Sakashita, whose mother has abandoned her. Kippei is assigned the task of being Yuzuru's caregiver until her mother returns, and the young girl quickly grows attached to him.\n\nThrough Yuzuru's influence and the intimate bond that forms between them, Kippei learns not only about childcare, but also about developing meaningful relationships. As Kippei balances his time between Kokoro and Yuzuru, they all grow together and learn more about each other, their feelings, and the true meaning of family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "After seeing Izumi Sano at a high jump competition, Mizuki Ashiya became completely enamored by him—even moving from the United States to Japan and enrolling in the same institute as him. However, Sano's academy is an all-boys school!\n\nDue to her bright personality, Mizuki quickly befriends her class without drawing suspension to her gender. To her surprise, she ends up being not only Sano's classmate but also his roommate. Though she is now able to admire Sano in close proximity, she learns that Sano has quit high jumping and refuses to pick up the sport ever again for unknown reasons. Moreover, the academy's doctor, Hokuto Umeda, might be onto Mizuki's facade. Now, Mizuki has to find a way to reignite Sano's passion—all without revealing her secret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Natsu no Ori (The Cage of Summer)\nVolume 4: Kawaki no Tsuki (The Thirsty Moon)",

        "synopsis": "Pi is a constant that defines a circle. It is never-ending, and to Sawaki Yumeto, it is a majestic number that has a direct relationship to his other favorite thing, boobs. One day, he realizes that there is a mystic relationship between pi and the perfect breasts. He conducted research and did calculations to determine what the perfect breasts are but he needed more raw data. Yumeto used to be unpopular and ugly, but to further his quest, he shed blood, sweat and tears to change his appearance and style to that of a handsome young man.\n\nWhen Tamura Jun, a classmate that has been absent for the majority of the school year, returns, Yumeto realizes that she might have the perfect boobs that he has been searching for. But getting to them is going to be harder than he could possibly imagine.\n\n(Source: MU)",

Of these, the Seven Heroes halted the invasion to herald a time of prosperity while the four Lances of Betrayal were supposedly defeated.\n\nTwo decades later, the Lances of Betrayal have reappeared and formed a bandit militia near the frontier fief Gormbark. A man with the black sword and a scar over his left eye slays an entire troop of that militia. He is identified as a boy, Kóinzell, and becomes as much an object of fear as of hope even as his own past, motivations, and purpose are a mystery to those he meets in his travel.\n\n(Source: MU)",

        "synopsis": "High school student Riiko Izawa has gone through a series of unrequited crushes. Each time she works up the courage to confess to a boy, he rejects her on the spot. After yet another rejection, Riiko becomes dejected and takes a walk through a nearby park. There, she discovers a lost phone and returns it to its owner.\n\nThe owner of the phone, Gaku Namikiri, is bizarre, to say the least. A traveling salesman, he pesters Riiko to accept one of his company's products as a reward. She tells him, sarcastically, that what she wants most of all is a boyfriend. Unfazed, he directs her to visit a website advertising \"lover figures,\" which she assumes to be dolls. Despite her skepticism about the company's integrity, the face of the \"Nightly Series 01\" model enchants Riiko, and she registers for a three-day free trial. She is shocked when a life-sized naked boy is actually delivered to her the next day!\n\nRiiko follows instructions to activate the very realistic robot with a kiss, and for the next three days, Night Tenjou is the best boyfriend she could ask for. However, Gaku reappears to inform her that she missed the deadline to cancel the free trial, and now she owes one hundred million yen. Alternatively, she can decide to keep Night and act as a beta tester so that the company can collect data in order to improve their future products. What choice does Riiko have? She is broke, and what's more, she has already begun to fall for the artificially intelligent Night...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His best gal pal, Arumi, is about to move away, and his Osaka neighborhood is being demolished in the name of urban renewal.\n\nHowever, this little neighborhood has some surprises under its concrete—it's actually a portal to parallel universes. And when this section of the city is leveled, the portal is cracked wide open. Sasshi and Arumi soon find themselves being hurtled from one strange world to the next! Making matters even more surreal, is the fact that these worlds seem to spoof and mock popular movies, video games, manga and anime!\n\n(Source: TokyoPop)",

        "synopsis": "Itsuki Minami needs no introduction—everybody's heard of the \"Babyface\" of the Eastside. He's the toughest kid at Higashi Junior High School, easy on the eyes but dangerously tough when he needs to be. Plus, Itsuki lives with the mysterious and sexy Noyamano sisters. Life is never dull, but it becomes dangerous when Itsuki leads his school to victory over some vindictive Westside punks with gangster connections. Now he stands to lose his school, his friends, and everything he cares about. But in his darkest hour, the Noyamano girls come to Itsuki's aid. They can teach him a powerful skill that will save their school from the gangsters' siege–and introduce Itsuki to a thrilling and terrifying new world.\n\n(Source: Del Rey)",

One day at the train station, he meets a beautiful girl wearing a kimono, who has plans to visit someone but is struggling with directions. Kaoru decides to help her find her way; however, upon arrival at the location, they find an empty plot of land. While searching for any outstanding clues, the girl shows Kaoru a photo of the person she is looking for.\n\nAs destiny would have it, Kaoru immediately recognizes the individual as himself with his childhood friend—the previously betrothed Aoi Sakuraba from the esteemed Sakuraba family—who is now sitting across from him. Their wedding was canceled many years prior after Kaoru left the highly regarded Hanabishi clan for personal reasons. Despite their time apart, Aoi remains committed to Kaoru.\n \nWith this fateful encounter, Kaoru and Aoi are reunited, though they must keep their relationship a secret to preserve the reputation of the Sakuraba family. This is only complicated by the different women that Kaoru finds himself surrounded by. Even so, Kaoru and Aoi wish to learn more about each other and stay together against their families' wishes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At school she is known as \"Mayura's little sister\" and is relentlessly tormented by the older girls who know that Alice is too weak to fight back.\n\nAlice harbors a deep affection for Kyo Wakamiya, a handsome upperclassman who is on the archery team with Mayura. On the way to school one day, Alice rescues a white rabbit from the road despite the danger to herself, but gets rescued by Kyo and receives a bracelet with a single red stone. The rabbit she saves, however, is no ordinary rabbit. She reveals her true form to Alice and introduces herself as Nyozeka. Alice is told that she is destined to become a Lotis Master. The Lotis Masters use the power of words and communication to enter the Inner Heart of others. It is a powerful ability to be used carefully as Alice soon finds out.\n\nUsing the power of the Lotis Words, which reveal themselves to be in the form of runes, Alice accidentally makes her older sister disappear during a dispute over Kyo, whom Mayura had begun dating. Alice then must use the Lotis Words to try and bring her sister back from the dark. She is joined by Kyo who proves to have the Lotis powers as well, and by Frey, another Lotis master who had trained with the masters and arrives with the intention to marry Alice. Unfortunately, Mayura has been taken by the power of the Maram Words, the dark reflection of the Lotis Words. Their only hope lies in Alice and Kyo becoming the legendary Neo-Masters to discover the lost word bonding both Maram and Lotis.\n\n(Source: Mangatraders)",

Luckily, the timely intervention of Prince Kail saves Yuri from the queen's grasp. Kail promises to send Yuri back to her home, but the queen's persistent schemes to kill them both, plus their growing feelings for each other, keep those plans delayed.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 28: Orontes Renka",

        "synopsis": "In the distant future, humanity has terraformed Mars into an oceanic planet to suit their needs. Now known as Aqua, the planet serves as a new home for people discontent with living on Manhome—the planet formerly known as Earth. Being a perfect imitation of Manhome's Venice, the town of Neo-Venezia has inherited all of the rustic charms of the original. Gondolas weave their way through the waterways of the dreamy town while nostalgic alleys await those who travel on foot.\n\nAkari Mizunashi, a young Manhome native, has recently made Neo-Venezia her new home. To pursue her dream of becoming a gondolier tour guide—or Undine—Akari joins the Aria Company, one of the most renowned water guide companies in town. As she basks in a simple lifestyle unavailable on Manhome, Akari cheerily ambles through her daily life in Neo-Venezia: the town where magic and miracles abound.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their \"birthday present\" turns out to be a mummified hand—the power of which forces an awakening within Aya, and painful wounds all over Aki's body! Grandfather Mikage announces that Aki will be heir to the Mikage fortune, and Aya must die! But Aya has allies in the athletic cook and martial artist Yuuhi, and the attractive, mysterious Touya. But can even two handsome and resourceful guys save Aya when it's her own power that's out of control?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

Sakaki, who towers over Chiyo, is aloof and intimidating; Tomo Takino is loud and annoying; Ayumu \"Osaka\" Kasuga is absentminded but great at solving riddles; Koyomi \"Yomi\" Mizuhara is obsessed with diets and loves karaoke despite her awful singing; and Kagura, who is a competitive tomboy.\n\nAs the classmates become good friends over time, they experience their everyday lives together—things like school, studying, going on summer trips, and engaging in all kinds of shenanigans!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Princess Kyouko is about to turn 16 years old, and a large celebration will be held throughout the country. Unknown to the people, the princess has secretly been living among them as Kyouko Suomi, a headstrong and selfish junior high student. Kyouko has never appeared at any of the kingdom's past ceremonies, and doesn't plan to attend this ceremony either, for doing so will end her youthful school life.\n\nHowever, her father, the king of Earth, offers her another option—Kyouko must find the 12 telepaths who can use the God Stones in order to wake up her twin sister, Princess Ui, who has been asleep since her birth. If Kyouko succeeds, the king will allow her to live however she likes, and will pass on her duties to her sister. Accepting this offer, Kyouko is given the first of the God Stones, the Time-Space Stone, and will need to find the remaining God Stones and their users, with the help of her two bodyguards Sakataki and Hizuki Jin.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Soubi tells him that Ritsuka's true name is \"Loveless,\" and that Soubi was assigned by Seimei to take care of Ritsuka and protect him. Ritsuka soon gets sucked into a bizzare underground society where teams of people, a \"Fighter Unit,\" and a \"Sacrifice,\" battle using elaborate and beautifully-phrased spells.\n\nHe seeks both acceptance of himself, and the answer to the mystery of who killed his brother and why.\n\n(Source: TokyoPop)",

She prefers eating and playing video games to studying, which results in her notably poor grades. She also gets easily upset, whether by baseless insults or reasonable reprimands. It is very unlikely that she could be known as anything but a bad influence and a crybaby, but that begins to change when she meets a black cat.\n\nGiven a special brooch from the black cat named Luna, Usagi can use it to transform into a guardian of justice named Sailor Moon! She is now tasked to protect the Earth from all that is evil and to find both a missing princess and a sacred jewel known as the Mystical Silver Crystal. Whether she likes it or not, Usagi's beautiful transformation marks the start of meeting the mysterious Tuxedo Mask, fighting alongside new comrades, and learning to take responsibility in this acclaimed magical girl classic.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It has been over one thousand years since the Crisis of Systems (Lost Property), which resulted in the destruction of four planetary systems, leaving only a single inhabitable planet, Zion. Mankind is forced to live in space colonies, since that one planet is constantly being invaded by alien life forms that have come to be known as Victim.\n\nTo stop the aliens and to allow people to land on Zion, mankind has developed the astronomical humanoid weapons, Ingrids, also known as Goddesses. G.O.A. (Goddess Operation Academy) is a school dedicated to the training of young men to pilot these Ingrids...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

Known as Rozen Maidens, each doll was imbued with a Rosa Mystica—a precious gem that gives them life. But these dolls have a specific purpose: they must fight each other in a contest called the Alice Game. The winner becomes Alice, the perfect girl who will have the chance to meet their father and creator.\n\nJun Sakurada, a middle school shut-in, experiences the Alice Game up close and personal when one of these dolls arrives at his house. After winding her up with the spring provided, she comes to life and introduces herself as Shinku, the fifth Rozen Maiden. Despite Jun quickly becoming annoyed by her haughty attitude, they find themselves working together when they are attacked by another doll. At Shinku's behest, Jun becomes her medium, allowing her to use his life force as a power to defeat their enemies.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fight, more Rozen Maidens appear and decide to live at Jun's house. But can there be any peace when their very existence means they must fight each other?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, she notices mysterious, ring-like markings around the necks of two of her classmates, Chika Akatsuki and Shito Tachibana — two boys who miraculously survived a horrible accident six months before. Michiru, possessing the rare ability to see these rings, knows that they warn of impending death. Thinking that, perhaps, she can do something to save her classmates’ lives, she approaches them... but it seems the boys have already made a different kind of deal and garnered themselves a heavy debt \n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

Unseen by most, the Heart's Egg remains hidden within every individual, and represents a person's own ideal character.\n\nWhile adjusting to life at a new school, Amu Hinamori has unintentionally gained a reputation for being \"cool and spicy.\" Unhappy with her outward persona, Amu often wonders how she can act more like her true self. Her desire for change is manifested when one morning, Amu awakens to find three eggs beneath her. They hatch to reveal Ran, Miki and Suu—three \"Guardian Characters,\" each an embodiment of Amu's ideal self.\n\nShugo Chara! follows Amu's journey as the trio begin to show her just how much potential she has, encountering other Guardian Characters, and a few troublesome experiences along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Tooru Honda is an orphan with nowhere to go but a tent in the woods, until the Souma family takes her in. However, the Souma family is no ordinary family, and they hide a grave secret: when they are hugged by someone of the opposite gender, they turn into animals from the Chinese zodiac!\n\nNow, Tooru must help Kyou and Yuki Souma hide their curse from their classmates, as well as her friends Arisa Uotani and Saki Hanajima. As she is drawn further into the mysterious world of the Soumas, she meets more of the family, forging friendships along the way.\n\nBut this curse has caused much suffering; it has broken many Soumas. Despite this, Tooru may just be able to heal their hearts and soothe their souls.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Fruits Basket won the 25th Kodansha Manga Award in the Shoujo category in 2001. The series was published in English by Tokyopop from February 10, 2004, to July 6, 2009. The publisher later released a box set with the complete series and ultimate edition omnibus volumes that include new cover art. These releases were met with mixed reviews, as they were exact reproductions of the previously released volumes and did not adjust page numbers or correct prior errors. Yen Press republished the series in 12 omnibus volumes from June 28, 2016, to April 18, 2017. It was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora JBC from April 2005 to July 2007.",

        "synopsis": "At the age of four, Kiri Minase fell in love with her childhood friend Tohya Enishi and proposed to him. Their families, however, were not very supportive of this match. Both children have parents who work as models and to whom they owe their good looks. The trouble is, Kiri inherited chiseled masculine features from her father and Tohya inherited his mother's delicate beauty. For years, Kiri has been working hard toward becoming a girl worthy of Tohya, but even now, she faces constant reminders that everyone regards her as unsuitable for him due to her lack of femininity.\n\nOne day, Tohya is scouted by a fashion photographer and agrees to work as a model for the agency owned by Kiri's mother. Kiri is concerned that Tohya will be preyed upon by other men in the fashion world, and so she begs her mother to hire her as well. Her wish is granted with a twist, as she is forced to pose as a male model under the name \"Tatsuki.\" During their first photo shoot, it seems that Kiri's worries are well-founded when the photographer won't keep his hands off Tohya. With the desire to protect Tohya warring against the fear that she will appear undesirable to him the longer she pretends to be male, Kiri must come to terms with her identity and decide if outer beauty is really more important than what lies inside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "While most people find the world mundane, five-year-old Yotsuba Koiwai sees it as a treasure trove of amazing bustle and wonderful places to explore. When she and her adoptive father, Yousuke, move to a new city, the energetic young girl naturally sets out to investigate the neighborhood on her own.\n\nAfter a few incidents at the local park, the Koiwais become acquainted with their neighbors, the Ayase family. Their three daughters—mischievous college student Asagi, responsible high school student Fuuka, and kindhearted grade school student Ena—eventually all take a liking to Yotsuba and join in on her antics, despite their sheer ridicule.\n\nFrom learning how to use a swing to figuring out how to stop global warming with air conditioners, Yotsuba's ability to infallibly find fun in everything, both amazes and annoys the people around her. Along with Yousuke, the Ayases, and friends she makes along the way, Yotsuba embarks on daily adventures, each one a step in her quest to enjoy the simple things in life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day not long after entering the fourth grade, Sakura finds a mysterious book titled The Clow hidden within her father's bookshelves. Upon opening it, a small, winged creature with an Osakan accent comes out of the book and introduces itself as Keroberos, the Creature of the Seal who guards magical cards known as the Clow Cards and keeps them from escaping the book.\n\nUnfortunately for the plushy guardian, it seems that the Clow Cards have already escaped—and now Sakura is tasked with capturing them before the cards unleash their powers and cause havoc all over Tomoeda!

Concurrently, he works daily shifts at a bar to make ends meet, thus missing out on the world's latest invention—human-like computers called Persocoms. Longing for a persocom of his own, Hideki is met with a stroke of luck when he stumbles upon a cute abandoned persocom in a garbage pile.\n\nUpon finding the power button, Hideki finds his newfound robot to be faulty and only capable of uttering the word \"Chii\"—which Hideki decides to name her after. Chii, however, is no ordinary persocom: capable of thinking and learning on her own, she is a legendary type of robot known as a Chobit. Now, it is up to Hideki to teach Chii how to live an ordinary life and to uncover the truth behind the elusive chobits series.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Luckily, a cold-blooded young man named Rikuo Himura saves him and brings him to his boss, Kakei, owner of Green Drugstore. Out of necessity, Kazahaya agrees to become Kakei's employee.\n\nHowever, Kazahaya's job is not limited to organizing shelves and dealing with customers. Due to his ability to see strange things, Kazahaya is commissioned to complete dangerous assignments in exchange for money. Begrudgingly paired, Kazehaya and Rikuo—who also seems to possess unique powers—must take on these missions while confronting ghosts from the past that are hunting them down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After he saves the creature, they introduce themselves as Kohaku, an angel from Heaven. Skeptical of the supernatural, Shuuichirou ignores Kohaku and goes back home, dismissing it as a dream.\n\nThe next day, Shuuichirou finds Kohaku in his garden, who has now taken on their true form. They tell him that, for his kindness, they want to grant him any wish. However, Shuuichirou is content with what he has and declines. Kohaku decides that, instead of doing nothing, they will stay with their savior until he desires something only they can deliver.\n\nAlthough Kohaku becomes accustomed to their homely life with Shuuichirou, they cannot remain on Earth for long due to being tormented by Kouryuu—a mischievous devil—and his sidekicks. In addition, Kohaku is on borrowed time to find the missing archangel Hisui and must hurry before they are both banished from Heaven forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having a leaf imprinted onto his hand by code, Kazuhiko is entrusted with a secret task to deliver a \"package\"—a girl with white hair and evergreen eyes whom he finds singing in a birdcage-like building. All Kazuhiko knows is that her name is Suu, and for whatever reason, she wishes to go to Fairy Park.\n\nAs his friends Lan and Gingetsu help set up a transport module for the duo, Kazuhiko suspects that there is more to Suu than he knows. Not only is their transport intercepted, but the two are also pursued by Bols—a face that is uncomfortably familiar to Kazuhiko and who seems to have received his own mission to seek out Suu. The truth behind the discreet nature of this operation, Suu's existence, and even a possible connection between her and Kazuhiko may all be linked to just one word: clover.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They came seeking the King's Edel Raid, rumored to be one of the Shichikou-houju (Seven Glittering Jewels).\n\nSensing their intent, the King hid his daughter with his Edel Raid and fought against the invasion but was defeated in battle that resulted in the desert kingdom being blanketed in a sheet of white snow.\n\nEscaping capture, the Crown Princess Achea Fuajarl XIV reacted with Jeen, the King's Edel Raid, and along with Puffe, the Kingdom's only mechanic, fled Fuajarl in an ancient tank. They are on a journey to restore the Kingdom and exact vengeance on the Garden of Eden.\n\nThis story takes place two years after Erementar Gerad.\n\n(Source: MU)",

Despite appearing to wander around, the pure-hearted girl aspires to fulfill one precious wish: to reach a particular place. But for it to be granted, she must learn how to heal the wounded hearts of the people and collect them in a magic bottle.\n\nHowever, the world can be confusing for such an innocent girl. Her companion Ioryogi can be quite rough in teaching her common sense, especially for a talking blue dog plushie! Luckily for Kobato, a certain quaint place with a troubled history seems to be—and may be looking for—a glimmer of hope.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They are soon greeted by Guru Clef, a youthful-looking man who informs them that they are the legendary Magic Knights summoned by Princess Emeraude to save this magical land known as Cephiro.\n\nWhile Hikaru finds the prospect exciting, Umi and Fuu simply want to return to their own world. Unfortunately for them, Clef explains that they cannot go home until they have saved Cephiro and banished the monsters plaguing it. In order to do so, they have to rescue Princess Emeraude from the clutches of the powerful Lord Zagato. To stand a chance against him, they must revive mysterious beings called Rune Gods.\n\nAs Clef grants the trio armor and magic, one of Zagato's servants attacks, forcing the guru to send the girls away to the weaponsmith Presea and the rabbit-like guide Mokona, who can further equip them for their journey. Though they have a long way to go, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu will show that they have what it takes to live up to their titles as Magic Knights and bring salvation to Cephiro.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ken confesses that he is in love with the girl, mi, and asks Natsu for a divorce. Natsu doesn't really feel shocked OR sad, for some strange reason.

Then, one sleepless night, she sees an angel sitting on her balcony... and soon after, the angel begins living with her. \n\nIncluded in this volume are three more short manga stories: God Knows Everything, Tea Time and Dispensation of Heaven.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

        "synopsis": "The year is 2301, one hundred fifty years since terraforming operations began on the planet Aqua—formerly known as Mars—causing it to be almost entirely covered with water. Aqua's capital, Neo-Venezia, is a near-perfect copy of the wonderful, dreamy city of Venice back on Manhome—previously known as Earth. Citizens and tourists alike take their time exploring the city and admiring its rustic charm, especially by riding one of the many gondolas gliding along the waterways.\n\nHighly skilled and knowledgeable women known as Undines navigate the gondolas and act as tour guides of Neo-Venezia. Originating from Manhome, several well-renowned Undine companies have made their home in the capital, with many young girls aspiring to join their ranks.\n\nChasing her dream of becoming an Undine, Manhome native Akari Mizunashi begins her training as an apprentice at the Aria Company. Soon after arriving in town, she becomes acquainted with her mentor Alicia Florence, a pudgy cat named Aria Pokoteng, and Aika S. Granzchesta, a fellow Undine apprentice from the Himeya Company. Together with her new friends, Akari strives to become a full-fledged Undine while taking in all the magical sights and sounds that Neo-Venezia generously offers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Othello Game (Ebony &amp; Ivory)",

Though this blade is coveted by many, only the heirs to the House of Manas can wield it. But that doesn’t stop the sinister from trying. Ernan, once trusted knight of the House of Manas, murders his commander, robs him Brumhart and orders the death of Leon’s only son, Zian. But the men sent to perform this infanticide come up against a mysterious figure in a dark cloak who defeats them only to disappear with child into the thick of the Tass Forest. Sixteen years later, Ernan has become a feared tyrant, but still has not been able to unsheathe Brumhart. Thus begins the tale of this desperate king and the young boy who would be one.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

The three girls, Shem, Hamu and Japheth, are sisters from another world. Equipped with magical powers, they are charged with saving all the creatures of Earth from becoming extinct. However, there is someone or something sinister trying to stop them. While saving our world from destruction, these sisters live like normal human girls: They go to school, work at a flower shop, hang around with friends and even fall in love...\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

The store's proprietor is an enigmatic young man who goes by the name of Count D.\n\nCount D welcomes those who feel lonely and wounded through the doors of his shop, claiming to sell \"love, dreams, and hope\" in the form of the fantastic beasts that lie within. Each creature comes with a special contract accompanied by a set of rules. However, he warns customers that he cannot be held accountable for any consequences of breaking the rules.\n\nShort-tempered detective Leon Orcot traces the source of several crimes back to Count D and what the former considers to be a pet shop of horrors. Determined to find proof that the Count is a criminal, he begins to pay regular visits to the shop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He attempts to reunite with his brother Koutarou, who left Germany five years ago to study robotics at a university. Unfortunately, no sooner than his brother begins an exhibition about an advanced form of machine, he's kidnapped by a mecha in the shape of a wasp and a servant of the Machine Empire. Teppei starts a chase, using a gauntlet known as the \"Messiah Fist\" to hold onto the wasp as it travels to a secretive base in the Gobi Desert which serves as the Empire's headquarters.\n\nGetting thrown into a garbage heap and facing a cyborg he somehow is familiar with, Teppei's blood awakens a relic from the past; a kirin-type B't known only as \"X\" which, five years ago, was considered the most powerful B't in existence. Both are equally stubborn, although quite different in many ways, and after a few initial squabbles, X resolves to help Teppei in his quest to save his brother.\n\n(Source: TVTropes)",

        "synopsis": "Subaru Sumeragi is the 13th head of his powerful onmyouji clan. Until the time comes when he must succeed his grandmother fully, Subaru is allowed to live in Tokyo with his fraternal twin, Hokuto. While Subaru is kind and shy, Hokuto has exuberance to spare, and her favorite pastime is designing bold matching outfits for the two of them to wear. Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city.\n\nSubaru has to resolve a variety of spiritual conflicts in Tokyo: some are cases formally brought to him by clients, and others are matters in which he decides to involve himself. A selfless teenager, he empathizes with others to the point that their pain may as well be his own. This leaves him vulnerable in a city where nearly everyone makes decisions that only benefit themselves as individuals. Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else. However, is Seishirou the best candidate for her brother's love, or is he hiding sinister secrets?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But Ginta is a dreamer and has had the same dream 102 times, always in the same fantasy world, where he is a hero blessed with all the abilities he lacks in real life.\n\nOne day, a supernatural figure appears at Ginta's school and summons him to a mysterious and exciting new world! In this strange universe filled with magic and wonder, he is strong, tough, agile—and he can see without his glasses! Thus, Ginta begins a mystical quest in search of the magical items known as \"ÄRMS,\" one of which may have the power to send him home. Joining him on this epic journey are his companion Jack and the valuable living, talking, mustachioed iron-ball weapon known as \"Babbo,\" which everyone wants but, it seems, only Ginta can possess! \n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

When his caretaker, the old ARM-smith that took him in after his parents' deaths, sends him out on an errand, he is attacked by a bandit from \"chess\"!

        "synopsis": "Often considered untrustworthy, Japanese ninja were in fact unwaveringly loyal to their masters. But in modern-day Japan, high school student and self-proclaimed ninja Rekka Hanabishi finds it difficult to carry on their legacy, that is, until he saves a cute girl named Yanagi Sakoshita from a group of delinquents.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, Rekka deems Yanagi worthy of being his master, swearing to protect her. As a sign of their trust, the two reveal their most valuable secrets to each other: Yanagi can quickly heal wounds, while Rekka can create fire with just a snap of his fingers. However, their dazzling exchange does not go unnoticed as a mysterious woman called Kage Houshi appears. She somehow knows about their powers and threatens them, claiming Rekka must be returned, for he is the only one who can kill her.\n\nThe pair hold their ground, but before things can escalate any further, Kage Houshi calmly leaves. Thinking the crisis is over, Rekka and Yanagi continue their daily lives, unaware that they are about to be dragged into a centuries-long ninja conspiracy with the lives of their friends and their own on the line.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Initially believing to be on a graduation trip, Shuuya Nanahara and the rest of Shiroiwa Junior High's Class B find that they have been chosen to participate in this game of life and death known as The Program.\n\nWaking up to the realization that they have been quarantined on an island, the 42 students discover they have been fitted with metal collars which will detonate if certain conditions are not met. In order to obtain freedom, they must slaughter everyone else by whatever means necessary, and the last one standing is deemed the winner. As each member of the class heads down their own path, Shuuya makes it his goal to get off the island without playing the game in order to put an end to this madness once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Through this encounter, Koyuki realizes what he has been missing all this time as Ray introduces him to western rock music and jumpstarts his desire to play guitar.\n\nAlthough various struggles plague his path to rock fame, Koyuki refuses to abandon the passion that gave his life purpose, balancing it together with school, work, and friends. Beck tells the story of the love and trial that accompanies pursuing a professional career in music as Koyuki and Ray work toward realizing the guitarist's dream of the ultimate band.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In this dystopia, only a strange young man known as Killy is brave enough to traverse its unforgiving territories. \n\nPossessing superhuman strength and a rare Graviton Beam Emitter, Killy fights off bloodthirsty beasts and other fiendish forces in his desperate search for a human with the Net Terminal Gene—genetic information that holds the potential to restore the corrupt world. \n\nThe dark world of Blame! follows Killy as he meets new people, sheds more blood, and draws closer to finding the Net Terminal Gene. Through these exploits, the true nature of the world is slowly pieced together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Chiyuki Matsuoka's given name literally means \"thousand snow,\" and it embodies her parents' wish for her to witness the first snowfall of the year perennially. This wish is exceedingly optimistic due to Chiyuki's heart condition, which increases the risk of seizures and decreases her life expectancy. The doctor who presided over her birth said she would be lucky to live 15 years.\n\nChiyuki is 17 years old when she meets the unlikely vampire Touya Kanou. He claims to hate blood, and he refuses to find a human partner with whom to share the rest of his life. Touya is 18 now, but if he took blood continually from a partner, then they both might live to be a thousand years old. \n\nChiyuki immediately volunteers to be Touya's partner, but he shoves her away in disgust, inadvertently learning of her poor health when she starts to spasm. Touya treats Chiyuki more kindly after that, but still refuses to drink her blood. She begins to suspect that there is a different reason why he keeps turning her down, but will she live long enough to discover the truth?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Isshunkan no Romance (A Romance of One Moment)",

The daughters of wealthy families snub her, other students make light of the fact that she actually tested into Meio instead of relying on family connections, and the cute boy she saw tending a dandelion the day before wouldn't even acknowledge her existence. Hoping to make friends and have some fun, Tanpopo starts up a gardening committee, but will this help her survive in a school where superficiality and nepotism reign supreme? \n\n(Source: Viz)",

To prove it is haunted, Mai and her friends try to summon a specter by telling ghost stories. No ghosts appear, but the group encounters Kazuya Shibuya, a 17-year-old transfer student. Though her friends are charmed by Kazuya's attractive looks and great manners, Mai does not trust him.\n\nFollowing a mishap, Mai discovers Kazuya's real identity as the president of Shibuya Psychic Research, a group hired by the school principal to investigate the building's rumored paranormal activity. As a consequence of her actions, Mai must temporarily help Kazuya if she does not want to pay him damages. Joined by other individuals experienced with the supernatural—former Buddhist monk Houshou Takigawa, self-proclaimed Shinto priestess Ayako Matsusaki, famous medium Masako Hara, and Catholic priest John Brown—Mai and Kazuya must uncover the mystery surrounding the building before any more innocent lives are lost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Young Marin's only chance to survive rests with Melan Blue, the Gun-Swordsman, who is destined to protect her. With arms made of weapons, the power of flight, and retractable body armor, Melan is a powerful bodyguard indeed.\n\nWho is sending the Monamakia? Why do they want Marin dead? Who sent Melan to protect her? What is the secret of Brigadoon? With her new protector by her side Marin sets out across two worlds to discover the answers.\n\n(Source: MU)",

        "synopsis": "After being hit by a car, strange things begin to happen around Nanaki Shunsuke. He is eventually approached by another young man named Ao, who tells Nanaki that he has been sending Ao his telepathic \"voice,\" and that the accident seems to have awakened some sort of supernatural powers within Nanaki.\n\nThough less than enthusiastic about the idea, Nanaki eventually agrees to join LOCK, The Paranormal Investigations Agency, and partner up with Ao to investigate various cases dealing with the supernatural. However, Nanaki's powers are rather unstable, and Ao seems to have some reason to carry a great mistrust and annoyance for his new partner, making Nanaki's days in his new position a rather trying ordeal. But as they work alongside one another in their pathetically understaffed branch of LOCK, the two find ways they might manage to keep working together, perhaps even without getting the other killed in the process.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Divine: Bokura wa Hikari wo Mita",

Well, if Scorpion or the Dragon Head Family doesn't kill them, the extra mouths to feed certainly will.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

This fact is especially apparent for three fairies: Sunny Milk, Luna Child, and Star Sapphire. Having unique abilities that make them more powerful than the average fairy, they do almost anything they can to get a laugh out of their \"victims.\" However, considering that fairies are known as one of the weakest creatures around, their pranks are usually harmless. Even so, the rowdy trio's mischief is more than enough to bring trouble to anyone's day!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Even though he punches, kicks, and otherwise abuses fellow karate team member, Ryouta, on a daily basis, Tasuku has hidden feelings for his childhood friend. When Tasuku's mother died, Ryouta was always there to comfort him, and these emotions grew over time to become something else. Confused and embarrassed by his secret crush, Tasuku takes his frustrations out on Ryouta to keep him from ever knowing the truth. When Tasuku learns that his late mother may have been an \"ageman\" (ah-gay-man)--a woman who brings men good fortune—he starts to believe he's inherited these powers, too. Can having the ability to influence luck give Tasuku and Ryouta a future together? Or will all the people crawling out of the woodwork wanting to use Tasuku's power cause him to run screaming for the hills?!\n\n(Source: DokiDoki)",

Works of art come from the deepest depths of an artist’s soul, so how can anyone else be expressing themselves so much like Takashiro? Filled with a yearning to find his artistic soulmate, Takashiro goes off to art school in Tokyo and meets classmate Sakae Fujiwara. Soon, Takashiro learns that this is the artist he’s been searching for – the one who created a Color so much like his own – but Sakae is a guy! Can such a profound connection between two people transcend gender and become something more?\n\n(Source: Dokidoki)",

Only knowing the family name \"Sudou,\" Asuka goes in search to find her absent father.\n\nOn her journey, she finds a guy being rather rough with a younger girl. Unable to resist, Asuka steps in by battering the guy with her motorcycle. When she discovers it was a big misunderstanding (Manato was just trying to get his sister Kazusa to go home), she drives them back to their house.\n\nOnce there, Asuka finds out that Manato and Kazusa are the Sudou family she's been looking for, but the father isn't there, not to mention their mother also being dead since long ago. With no other leads, Asuka decides to move in as the big sister until their father shows up. Things get tricky when love builds within the complex family relationship...\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Otome no Jijou",

The true identity of this rising star is Lili Hoshizawa, an energetic 13-year-old girl who enjoys solving mysteries, athletic activities, and running her mother's fortune-telling business, \"Fortune Teller Spica.\" Using her knowledge of astrology, Lili reads clients' horoscopes by day and catches criminals by night!\n\nBut Lili soon finds that her carefree, crime-solving adventures will need some more caution when her childhood friend Hiromi Oikawa returns from America and is suspicious of her and Spica. His extensive studies in criminal psychology seems to have helped him in solving mysteries—rivaling Lili's astrology and crime-solving skills. But this zodiac detective has no time to worry about a possible rival, for there are many cases and mysteries out there that she must solve in the name of the star!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But when the secret organization known as the Wisdom Alliance tries to exploit her as a weapon to enslave the world, her father puts his life on the line to protect her. And Mai soon learns the hard way that her powers are no joke, but capable of unbelievable, deadly force!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

There's a strange symbol on his palm, testimony to what his is. Inaba and Yukia are two of the Kira's closest friends. However, because he is a special type of his species, Kira is wanted by others for the power he can bring. The mysterious Rosen Kroitz Secret Society seems to know a great deal about the Saramanda, keeping them as pets and breeding them. One day, Kira is captured by his pursuers, and Inaba and Yukia chase after the car he's trapped in. The accident that follows changes everything for the friends, as does the appearance of Kira's older brother... (Source: Storm in Heaven)",

Over five hundred years ago, he ate a mermaid; now, Yuta is in search of a cure, hoping the mermaids know the secret. When he stumbles upon a hidden village, he quickly learns that it is full of mermaids that live in an underground society centered around the murder and cultivation of young human women to maintain their own youth and immortality. \n\nTheir most recent victim, Mana, is given the flesh of a mermaid to eat in order to fulfill the recipe toward being a perfect candidate to be eaten. Yuta helps her escape, and they find themselves on a journey to live their lives as normal as they can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Ningyo Series began publication in Shounen Sunday Zoukan and later moved to Weekly Shounen Sunday. It was published sporadically during its serialization. The original Japanese release was two wideband volumes and was incomplete; the second was complete in three small size volumes. The first two story arcs were serialized in English in the 1993 March issue of VIZ Media's Animerica—Anime & Manga Monthly magazine. The remaining stories were subsequently published in comic book format by VIZ Select Comics, with four issues to each part titled Mermaid Forest, Mermaid's Dream, Mermaid's Promise, Mermaid's Scar, Mermaid's Gaze and Mermaid's Mask, published from 1993 to 1995. The series was additionally printed in standard tankoubon format by VIZ Graphic Novels in three volumes titled Mermaid Forest, Mermaid's Scar, and Mermaid's Gaze, from December 6, 1994, to March 8, 1997. VIZ Media republished the title in four volumes as Mermaid Saga from July 14, 2004, to December 22, 2004, in the original right-to-left order. A two-volume collector's edition was later released. The series was also published in Argentina as Cuentos de Sirenas by LARP Editores from November 2008 to April 2009.",

Ono has come a long way since the agonizing day in high school when he confessed his love to handsome Tachibana. Now, some 14 years later Ono, a world-class pastry chef and gay playboy has it all. No man can resist Ono's charms (or his cooking skills!), but he has just found a new position under a man named Tachibana. Can this be the only man who resisted his charms, and if so, will the man who once snubbed the \"magically gay\" Ono get his just desserts? And how in the heck did a former middleweight boxing champion wind up as Ono's cake boy?\n\n(Source: DMP)",

Oota is a Zashiki Warashi, a protective house-spirit without a home, and is also Tatsuki's subservient lover.

With a prototype already active, the besieged Federation forces strike back using their new weapon, the mobile suit Gundam, with devastating consequences. Amidst the fighting, young electronics wizard Amuro Ray is determined not to let his friends and family die in the crossfire. But what can one boy do to repel a squad of mobile suit-clad invaders?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

The last surviving member of the royal family thinks Pacifica will grant him eternal life. A genie claims, \"Pixies are the treasures of the world, with the poor to integrate anything and everything in the universe.\" Our heroes, frankly, care more about where their next gourmet meal is coming from. But it's hard to travel incognito when you're accompanied by a pretty little pixy with huge, translucent, shimmering wings! (Source: Viz)",

However, there is another candidate—the princely, handsome Rei, who turns out to be a cousin of Akira's.

Hirose has trouble with bullies, but Taisuke is always there to defend him, even though he just winds up getting beaten instead of Hirose. During class one day, Taisuke is hit by something unworldly and for that split second, he sees a vision of the universe. As he's walking home from school, he sees a girl fall and die in front of him, but his first thought is jealousy. He later finds out that the strange sensation that hit him is spreading throughout Japan. Those who are struck by it either commit suicide or \"evolve,\" but the comrades that evolve usually have dark intentions for the rest of the world.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Currently in training as a Swordsman, Lewin is constantly picked on by classmates and teachers alike for his lack of talent. But one day in the library, Lewin makes a couple of friends from the Magic division, and for the first time ever there are people who actually enjoy his company. However, a visit to the Magic division's labs goes awry when Lewin and his new friends accidentally unleash an army of undead! Now a team of inexperienced first-year students must fend off a magical dilemma that even the school professors would have trouble with.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "The Kouga Manjidani and the Iga Tsubagakure ninja clans have been sworn enemies for centuries, with only the Hanzo Hattori truce maintaining a tenuous peace between the two families. But years later, when former shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa faces a dispute to determine which of his two grandsons shall succeed their father, he decides to settle the matter through a proxy war. Selected to represent the respective candidates, the Kouga and Iga send 10 of their best fighters into a deadly battle, with the winning party deciding the rightful successor. Thus, the truce is revoked and the ruthless bloodshed begins.\n\nBut not all approve the truce's end. Gennosuke of Kouga and Oboro of Iga were to be married in hopes of ensuring lasting peace. However, unlike typical arranged marriages, they were already deeply in love. As preparations for the war ensue, Gennosuke questions his loyalties while Oboro refuses to fight. Fueled by their reawakened feud, will the two clans be consumed by hatred, or have their destinies changed by genuine love?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When tempers rise, so do mop handles, giant boulders and repair bills. Meet Jun, a mild mannered high school student with a sharp tongue and superhuman strength. Tarou, a clean freak with a deadly aim in the art of mopping. Maki, a sloppy, lazy woman chaser. Minagawa, a talented pastry chef equally skilled in the arts of voodoo, and the impulsive, cheerful, though desperately unfortunate Tokumi. A feast of comedy based on the popular Japanese radio drama.\n\n(Source: DMP)",

To make things worse, Chika’s been secretly in love with Sohei for years, and has about had it with waiting for Sohei to figure it out. With his upcoming pro test, his squabbles with the youngsters in the boxing club, and Chika’s increasingly bold advances, will Sohei finally find some direction and happiness in his life?\n\n(Source: Juné Manga)",

In front of Ryouji, Tooru hides his feelings and acts as if he is just one of Ryouji's good friends, but in a moment out of the blue his world will be turned upside down as Ryouji will confess a secret desire for Tooru. Dazzled, Tooru can barely hide his excitement for Ryouji and quickly accepts his offer. As time passes, Tooru's happiness begins to fade knowing that his affair with Ryouji was just a fling based out of Ryouji's sexual curiosity.\n\nTooru, adamant about his feelings for Ryouji, confides in another one of his close friend, Kashiwazaki, about his dilemma. The two set off to devise a plan to test Ryouji's true intentions by faking a romantic relationship. Soon after, a frustrated and jealous Ryouji attempts to pry Tooru out of the arms of Kashiwazaki. Is it just as they planned? Yeah! That is of course until Tooru realizes Kashiwazaki wasn't really faking! How could he not have seen it coming?\n\nBoth Tooru and Ryouji have hidden their feelings from each other in the past, but now they have discovered that they were not the only ones. Will Tooru and Ryouji be reunited or will their true feelings for each other go unfulfilled?\n\n(Source: DMP)",

In this tale of a past (or future?) that never was, in the age of Steam, masked dandies, dastardly supervillains, and sentient machines stalk a Japanese Gotham by night. Are the sharp wits and quick reflexes of wunderkind detectives Narutaki and pretty nurse Ling Ling enough to thwart evil and unravel the mysteries of this strange world? All steamed up.... When Narutaki meets Ling Ling, a pretty nurse with a dark secret, he gains both a true-blu friend and two new assistants. He'll certainly need all the help he can get when he is forced to do battle with such nefarious villains as the Phantom Knight, the Machine Baron, and Dr. Guilty!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

        "synopsis": "The new school year is here! Fujimori Academy students Kiriya Matsuoka and Tomoe Izumi have been chosen as this year’s princesses, but it’s going to take a lot of hard work to bring them up to speed. Enter former princesses Kouno, Shihoudani and Yutaka for a bit of princess training! Although Matsuoka and Izumi seem willing and able to take over the job of dressing up as girls and cheering at school events, they’re not exactly what you’d call “friends.” In fact, they seem to be about as opposite as two people can get. This animosity spells trouble for a student body that depends on their princesses to give them a warm, glowy feeling all year long. Can President Sakamoto and the ex-princesses convince Matsuoka and Izumi to bond for the sake of the school? Or will it take more than a common experience to bring two very different people together?\n\n(Source: Dokidoki)",

That is, except for one member of the clan-14-year-old Akira. At that awkward stage where teenagers feel out-of-place in general, Akira believes he's average in the looks department, which simply doesn't measure up. How can he be around his family when he feels like he's being judged against them all the time? Will Akira's complex about being \"different\" cause him to turn away from the people who love him most?\n\n(Source: Digital Manga Publishing)",

The other students are working hard to make Haru feel welcome—especially his chubby, loveable pal, Shota; however, Kai Majima, President of the Manga Club and all-around hard case, seems to be the one person intent on making Harutaro's school life a living nightmare.\n\n(Source: DMP)",

When he spots an injured high school student with a violin lying at his doorstep, he does not think twice about taking him in for the night. The fierce young man, introducing himself as Riya Narukawa, has no idea why he was unconscious in front of Atsushi's door but worries no further, as he claims that memory lapses are a common occurrence.\n\nThe following day, when Riya gets a sudden headache while playing the violin for Atsushi, he professes that he ran away from home because his dead brother's spirit inside him has been forcing him to play the violin. Stunned by the sudden revelation, a concerned Atsushi discovers that Riya is a prodigious violinist and the only son of a famous musician. Worried that things are not matching up, he soon learns that Riya has a multiple personality disorder, causing him to invent a deceased younger brother whom he believes to be within his soul. Carrying the weight of other people's expectations for his talent, Riya tries to come to terms with the underlying problems behind his psychological complications, all while understanding what Atsushi means to him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While pleasuring oneself is commonplace in a house full of teenage boys, Kasumi is nevertheless shocked when he catches his roommate Hiyori engrossed in self-indulgence. What’s more shocking is that Hiyori challenges Kasumi to stay and watch, that is, stay if Kasumi feels something for the older boy. Will he stay or go? Which option is more rewarding for Kasumi?\n\n(Source: Juné Manga)",

Their capability relies on the degree of affection their owner provides them. Nurture them with the best affection and the model will flourish.\n\nTogether for 10 years, the slothful Kotarou Izumi believes that Hazuki—a Hybrid Child whom he owns—will be in his life for eternity. But everything comes crashing down when the artificial human suddenly collapses.\n\nHybrid Child manifests the struggles of the Hybrid Children and their owners through three brief narratives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
