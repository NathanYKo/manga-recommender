    "synopsis": "After stealing a wallet on a train ride, pickpocket Jimmy believes that he has slipped away scot-free. However, upon meeting the gaze of Reese Heyman, he realizes that he has been caught red-handed. Yet rather than hand him over to the police, Reese only makes Jimmy work with him at the bookstore for a day.\n\nDespite the lenient punishment, Jimmy feels humiliated and enraged. Seeking revenge, he attempts to loot Reese's apartment; but instead, he discovers that the man is a former police officer! Terrified of what might happen, Jimmy abandons the raid and returns to his own life.\n\nStill wary of retribution for his attempted burglary, Jimmy overhears some cops gossiping about Reese's retirement. Intrigued by the retired cop's convoluted past, Jimmy pretends to have turned over a new leaf and asks Reese if he can continue working part-time at the bookstore. As they carry out their duties, Jimmy finds himself growing more fond of his co-workerâ€”and as his feelings morph into love, their relationship slowly flourishes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nLucky Bill",
