    "synopsis": "Iris, a lover of otome games, dies in a tragic traffic accident one night after work. The next moment, she opens her eyes to a very different situation. She finds herself on her knees in a church, where she quickly realizes that she has become Iris Lana Armelia, the main antagonist of the otome game she played just hours before her death. Now, the final scene at the end of the game is playing out before her eyes: Edward Tom Tasmeria—the second prince of the kingdom and Iris' fiancé—publically annuls their engagement and condemns Iris over her rude remarks to Yuuri Noir, with whom Edward is in a relationship.\n\nPossessing memories of both her current life as a duke's daughter and her life in Japan, Iris knows what will happen next. After she returns home, her father tries to banish her to a church, where she will live out the rest of her days as a nun. However, Iris refuses to accept her fate, and she convinces her father to make her the acting lord of Armelia. Armed with the knowledge and skills from her previous life, Iris now sets out to bring prosperity to her land and its people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
