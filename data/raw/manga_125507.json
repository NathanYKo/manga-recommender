    "synopsis": "To cover her expenses, university student Yuki Shirai works as a part-time rental girlfriend. Once a week, she has to manage the burn scar on her face and put on a fake personality—hiding her cold, calculating, and cynical self—all to suit her client's desires. Having grown up in a family lacking any warmth or love, she works believing money is the only thing that will never betray her.\n\nMeanwhile, Tsuji Souta is unlike Yuki's past clients. Having lied to his friend about having a girlfriend, he hires Yuki for a double date, from where they develop a growing acquaintance. As Tsuji discovers the true Yuki, she sees him as a refreshing change from her other clients. But as they get closer, the two wonder how far they should take this relationship, or perhaps they should just part ways as merely a client and rental girlfriend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
