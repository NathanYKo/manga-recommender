When Yunsu blackmails Chae-a with a murder she didn't commit, she begins searching for ways to escape the situation until the perfect opportunity presents itself. With Yunsu's life now at her mercy, the two begin a life-or-death game of cat and mouse, only to find themselves falling deeper and deeper into each other's traps...\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
