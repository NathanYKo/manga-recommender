    "synopsis": "Raizo Fuwa is a 25-year-old salaryman living in a cramped home and working in a crowded office in Tokyo. His hopes for improved conditions are dashed when the new office building his company is supposed to move into is condemned as unsafe because the construction company has been cutting corners. Since the old building is already being demolished, they have no choice but to \"temporarily\" move the office into Fuwa's new flat. The final complication arrives in the form of the new employee Izumi Hiyama, a high school dropout the boss has promised to take care of as a favor to her family. No landlords are willing to rent to a 15-year-old girl, so she too has to move into Fuwa's home/office.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
