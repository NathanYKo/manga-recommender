    "synopsis": "Naoe-kun, a massage therapist, is about to head home for the day when he's saddled with a rather strange patient. This lovely lady has emerald eyes, pointy ears, and grew up in the forest—everything about her screams \"elf,\" except for one thing: her bodacious body. It turns out she left her world but loves junk food in this one, and now her obsession has caught up with her. Can Naoe-kun help this loveable elf girl lose the weight—and keep it off?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Ganso Kissa Seiren, Rinrin Tanuki",
