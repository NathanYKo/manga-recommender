    "synopsis": "Midori Natori has been giving it all at her hum-drum office job for three years now, only to have the rug pulled out from under her when she's suddenly laid off. But just as she's feeling lost and adrift, she is summoned to the world of the visual novel she's currently playing, Fairy Tale of Jewels. And the person who summoned her there? None other than the game's cruel villainess, Lapis Tenebrau, who's trying to take down the main cast of the game. Driven into a corner, Natori pretends she's psychic and uses her knowledge of the game to save Lapis from danger. Now Lapis has taken a shine to her, and is going to make Natori her private secretary?! Can Natori handle this new job, and her growing feelings for her villainess boss?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
