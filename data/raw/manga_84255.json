    "synopsis": "Kouhei Sugihara lives in a world of total isolation due to him being hard-of-hearing. However, when the loud and boisterous Taichi Sagawa comes into his life, Kouhei discovers that Taichi's voice alone shines as bright as the sun. Easily misunderstood by most people, Taichi is taken aback when Kouhei notices his good-natured personality. Taichi's valiant personality urges Kouhei to demand more for himself, pushing him into the lively world that he had always yearned to live in. Through this, Taichi helps Kouhei find a community of people who are willing to listen and understand, though they might have to repeat themselves more than once. Through the ups and downs of living in two very different worlds, Taichi and Kouhei find a connection that transcends all barriers and runs deeper than just a regular friendship.\n\nHidamari ga Kikoeru is a touching story about loneliness, self-respect, and finding a bond through the commonalities that we all share as people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
