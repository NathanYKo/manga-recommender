The series was published in English as The Prince of Tennis by VIZ Media under the Shonen Jump imprint from April 21, 2004 to July 5, 2011. The manga has received multiple media adaptations. Since the Golden Week of 2003, Marvelous Entertainment has produced a series of musicals that are shown bi-annually, with each musical adapting one arc of the manga storyline. A live adaptation film was released in Japan on May 13, 2006, covering the storyline from when Ryoma arrives in Japan to the match against Hyotei Academy. Three Chinese dramas have been produced. Due to localization, the dramas feature different characters and cultural themes, but the story and characters' portrayal remain similar to the manga. A variety of video games based on the series, mostly tennis games or dating simulators, have been released in Japan across multiple consoles. A half-hour weekly radio show was also produced, featuring over 300 music CDs along with a large range of merchandise.",

The series began serialization in Shounen Gangan on May 12, 2006, and continued until June 12, 2009, after which it was put on hiatus. Shiro Amano then serialized Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days in the same magazine from issues 2009-09 to 2012-09. Kingdom Hearts II resumed serialization in Shounen Gangan on October 12, 2012, and ended on May 12, 2015. A special chapter was later published on August 12, 2015. Tokyopop published the first two volumes in English from July 31, 2007, to May 13, 2008, before release was discontinued. Yen Press republished the series in four omnibus volumes from July 30, 2013, to May 30, 2017. In November 2015, Shiro Amano stated that Kingdom Hearts II would be his last manga adaptation of the series. However, he later launched his adaptation of Kingdom Hearts III in 2019.",

With over 260 million copies sold worldwide, the series is the fourth best-selling manga of all time as of 2024. It is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump,\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. The series was serialized in English by VIZ Media in a monthly comic book anthology format from March 1998 to March 2005. The publisher later collected the series into traditional tankoubon volumes from March 12, 2003, to June 6, 2006. To closely follow the English anime localization, the series was split, with volumes 17 through 42 titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1 through 26. Other releases by VIZ Media include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover-based 3-in-1 edition, and a full-color edition of chapters 195 through 245. The series was also published in Spanish by Planet DeAgostini CÃ³mics; in German and Danish by Carlsen Verlag; and in French and Dutch by GlÃ©nat Editions.",

It started serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka shoujo manga magazine in May 1992 and stopped serialization in March 2003. Events depicted in the manga were too similar for comfort to real-life disasters that occurred in Japan, which contributed to the series' halt. Chapters of X have been collected in eighteen and a \"half\" volumes, out of a total twenty-one volumes expected. X has been adapted into various anime that speculate about events that occurred before the manga started or after the point where the manga left off. The series was published in English by VIZ Media as 3-in-1 omnibus volume from November 8, 2011 to August 13, 2013.",

        "background": "Naruto has sold over 250 million copies worldwide as of 2020, making it the 4th highest-grossing manga series of all time. It was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2014, and in the same year, Masashi Kishimoto was awarded Rookie of the Year in the media fine arts category by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs. The series was published in English by VIZ Media under the Shonen Jump imprint from August 16, 2003, to October 6, 2015. In the last four months of 2007, the campaign titled Naruto Nation was launched, in which three volumes were published each month so that US releases would be closer to Japan's. The same practice was done in February through April of 2009, this time titled Generation Ninja. A 3-in-1 omnibus edition was later released. A box set containing volumes 1 through 27 was released on August 6, 2008, a set containing volumes 28 through 48 on July 7, 2015, and the final box set with volumes 49 through 72 on January 5, 2016. It was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Panini Comics from May 2007 to June 2015; in German by Carlsen Verlag; and in French and Dutch by Kana. Numerous databooks, artbooks, novels, and fanbooks on the series have been released. Eight summary volumes featuring unaltered color pages, larger dimensions, and exclusive interviews, covering the first part of the series were released between November 7, 2008, and April 10, 2009.",
