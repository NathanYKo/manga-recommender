    "synopsis": "On rainy mornings, high school student Takao Akizuki skips class and travels to an enchanting garden nestled in the bustle of Tokyo. Aspiring to become a shoemaker, he spends his time sketching and studying designs. During one visit amid the verdant scenery, Akizuki encounters Yakari Yukino—a mystifying woman whose melancholic appearance captures the young boy's eye.\n\nDespite not introducing themselves, the two continue to meet at the same spot, gradually finding comfort in each other's presence. However, with the end of the rainy season approaching, Akizuki and Yukino must confront the uncertainties in their hearts as they find the courage to walk their own paths.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
