    "synopsis": "In middle school, Hiro Momose was bullied and forced to be an errand girl for delinquents. Now a high school freshman, she is hoping to turn over a new leaf. Although the requirement states that each student must join a club, the clumsy Hiro is rejected by every club she has visited. Because of this, she ends up joining the \"Helper's Club,\" a group on the verge of disbanding with Dan Ichikura as its sole member.\n\nOn the surface, Ichikura seems like the perfect boy—boasting good grades, athleticism, and a reliable nature. However, he harbors a secret that hits a bit too close to home for Hiro: he was once a delinquent. When she finds out, Ichikura swears her to secrecy. Now, Hiro must avoid returning to her middle school days and make this chance encounter work out for them both.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
