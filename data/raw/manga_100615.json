    "synopsis": "After the tragic loss of her mother, Misha Takanashi had all but shut herself away from the world. Her father desperately tried to hire new maids in order to take care of her and the housework while he's busy with his own job, but it was to no avail as she manages to run them out of the position—all of them except one.\n​\nBefore she knows it, Misha finds herself the center of attention of one Kamoi Tsubame, an eccentric ex-JSDF master sergeant who isn't fazed in the slightest by Misha's attempts to drive her away. Enamored by the adorable little girl, Tsubame makes it her personal goal to get Misha to open up her heart to her (and maybe even get her to wear the cute clothes she makes as well.)\n​\nWhile her intentions are (mostly) good, Tsubame has a habit of taking things to the extreme when it comes getting closer to Misha, leading to all sorts of crazy situations that exasperate her to no end.\n\nNow, the pressure is on as Misha tries to find a way to deal with a maid who's just way too annoying!\n\n(Source: Kaiten Books)",
