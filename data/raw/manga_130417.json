    "synopsis": "Being a lover of cute and feminine things, Kiki Haruma has always dreamed of performing as a follower, a traditionally female role in the world of ballroom dancing. Unfortunately, she is a tall girl at an all-girls high school and, as such, is seen as unsuitable for the role. Not wanting to shake the boat, Kiki submits to expectations and becomes a leader instead.\n\nNow a second-year, Kiki receives a sudden notice from Shion Nemunoki, her best friend and follower, that they should stop being partners. Luckily, Kiki then meets a doll-like and experienced first-year, Michiru Toribami, and asks to be her leader. To Kiki's surprise, Michiru wants to be the leader and is annoyed that Kiki made assumptions based on her appearance. But despite their opposing interests, the two realize they are a perfect match.\n\nWith Kiki as the tall follower and Michiru as the petite leader, their newfound partnership begins. Through their abnormal composition and passionate dance, the pair strives to challenge accepted norms in spite of criticism and conflict.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
