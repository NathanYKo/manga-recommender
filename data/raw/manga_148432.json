    "synopsis": "A Korean woman has found her dream job as a zookeeper. Since she loves wild animals, she finds happiness in even cleaning their cages. But the job is also extremely dangerous, and it quickly becomes the cause of her death. The woman wakes up in the forest of an unknown world, only to realize that she is reborn as a crow—the most ominous animal to exist.\n\nDetermined to survive, she sets out to find someone who would take her as a pet. Suddenly, she notices a wounded yet familiar man sitting on a tree. After she helps him escape from an orc attack, the man warms up to her and names her Rainelle.\n\nRainelle soon remembers the man's identity: he is Camute Ivel Volphric, the first prince of the Volphric empire and a side character in a game she played three years ago. Now Camute's confidant, Rainelle must find a way to protect the prince from his hideous younger brother—despite her memories of the game being almost nonexistent.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
