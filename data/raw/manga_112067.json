    "synopsis": "Shuuto Haruno is a casual gamer who uses the handle \"Kalbi\" online. For weeks, he has been talking to \"Maorin,\" a cute girl with a sweet personality. Now, the two have finally decided to meet up in real life. Haruno is hopeful that maybe his desire for a girlfriend will finally be fulfilled, but his friends are not so sure. Warning him about the dangers of meeting with strangers online, they fill Haruno with the fear that Mao may not be what she seems.\n\nChoosing to believe in the girl he has grown to love, Haruno goes anyway. His suspicions begin to grow when Mao runs extremely late, and finally, his deepest fears are confirmed when his beloved \"Maorin\" arrives as Mao Suzuki, a man. What's worse is that Haruno attends the same college as Suzuki, who is extremely popular and completely out of Haruno's reach.\n\nDespite their awkward encounter and Mao's true gender, the two bond quickly over their common interests, mainly games. Haruno comes to find that Suzuki still possesses the cute qualities he fell in love with online. But with the knowledge that even the stony-faced Suzuki will smile for a particular girl, will Haruno's feelings remain unrequited?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
