    "synopsis": "In CLAMP's take on the Alice in Wonderland saga, Miyuki finds herself in a world which seems to be populated solely by a series of scantily-clad women interested exclusively in exploring her charms. Needless to say, hi-jinks and misunderstandings ensue as our young heroine attempts to escape their clutches and return to her regular life.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
