    "synopsis": "She wants a boyfriend—anyone but him. He wants girls to buzz off. Sucks for them 'cos he's paid to please princesses! High school freshman Mugi can barely muster the confidence to talk to a boy, much less to take one on a date. Plus, the first time she meets Kei Kurose, the wrong sort of sparks fly—even if Kei is head-turningly hot, who could put up with the way he treats girls like trash? Mugi has no patience for his rude attitude, but when she just so happens to discover the scandalous secret of his part-time job, she might have to learn to keep his trust!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
