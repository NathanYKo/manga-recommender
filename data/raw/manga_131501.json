    "synopsis": "Tamaki Mishina was getting out. Escaping from the tiny village where everyone loathed her for things beyond her control, especially since her dad—her last tie to the town—had recently passed away. That's why she applied to a high school in Tokyo in the first place. But then she got sent packing from her boardinghouse, woke up in Mr. Playboy Punk Rocker's apartment, and just kinda stayed there because she didn't have anywhere else to go. Too bad Rou keeps trying to kick her out because he's pretty sure she doesn't understand what it really means to live with a guy...\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
