    "synopsis": "Izumi, a university student part-timing at a manga cafe, got curious about a regular customer. Her name is Honami, a high school girl who's been coming to the manga cafe recently. This defenseless and seemingly cute girl whom he can't take his eyes off of has a secret...!?\n\nThis is a slightly naughty, heartful love comedy where this gentle pair will get to \"enjoy\" their youth to the fullest!!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
