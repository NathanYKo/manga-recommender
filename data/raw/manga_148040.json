    "synopsis": "Sunghoon Lee is nothing but a victim of a changing world, a powerless man in a land infested with beasts and magic. Monsters from another world invaded Earth, and they brought with them a sickness that pushes Sunghoon's mother into an endless sleep. To pay off her medical bills, he braved a dangerous job as bait used by powerful superhumans called Awakeners to hunt monsters. But when he found himself at death's door, the image of his past life flashes through his mind. There, he found his truth: he is the reincarnation of the Sorcerer King!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
