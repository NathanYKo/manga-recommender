    "synopsis": "Physical therapist Dan Kim has been down on his luck for as long as he can remember. Between an ailing grandmother, menacing loan sharks, and an old boss making it almost impossible for him to find work, Dan is truly running out of options. Naturally, it feels like a dream come true when he's finally hired to treat top-paid MMA fighter Jaekyung Joo, especially when the man then calls him out for a treatment the night before a match with an oh-so-tantalizing offer of five thousand dollars. He claims to have a \"jinx\" in need of a particular type of \"treatment,\" but it's one that Dan isn't quite prepared to offer... You see, Jaekyung may be a beast in the ring, but he's even rougher in the bedroom, and Dan's not sure he can survive Jaekyung at his most primal. Nevertheless, the promise of much-needed cash has Dan agreeing to this ill-fated deal... Could a night together be the thing to help Jaekyung break this jinx once and for all?\n\n(Source: Lezhin Entertainment)",
