    "synopsis": "Dahlia Academy is an elite school that houses students from two countries at odds: the nation of Touwa to the east, and the Principality of West across it. As the long-lived strife between the two sides continues, Romio Inuzuka—leader of the \"Black Doggies\" of Touwa—finds himself in a bind. He has fallen in love with Juliet Persia, head of the \"White Cats\" of the West.\n\nRomio confesses to Juliet one night, swearing he will change the world alongside her. She accepts, but they must keep their relationship an absolute secret in order to maintain peace at the school. As they strive to change the world, can these two star-crossed lovers keep their love a secret?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
