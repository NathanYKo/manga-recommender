    "synopsis": "The rumored \"Grim Reaper\" possessing the ability to curse others by touch alone, Akane Nishimura, is just a regular elementary school girl with a gloomy appearance. Due to constant bullying from her classmates, Akane is isolated and friendless at school. However, when clueless transfer student Taiyou Takada is impressed with Akane's \"powers,\" he asks to be her friend. Taiyou's inadvertent assertiveness constantly makes Akane's heart flutter, filling her once-dull days with light.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
