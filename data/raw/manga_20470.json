Shin, a childhood friend of Tsubaki's, coldly turned his back on her now that she was poor. Furious, Tsubaki, threw herself into becoming a top oiran girl to beguile him with her looks and then reject him one day! But plans are never as easy as they seem. For one, the beautiful and cold-hearted Takao stands in her way.\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 4: Ginrou no Sakura (The Silver Wolf's Sakura)",
