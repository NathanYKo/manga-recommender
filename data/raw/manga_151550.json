    "synopsis": "Since the advent of special abilities in humans, no one could rival the popularity of police officer Han Do-Ryeong. He is good-looking, kind, and one of the few people born with multiple strong talents. His skills make him exceptionally well-equipped to apprehend superpowered criminals and have led to a significant decrease in crime in South Korea. That is why an unknown individual causes a major commotion by dominating a fight against the police and even managing to harm the untouchable Do-Ryeong.\n\nThe Bureau of Special Abilities swiftly dubs the gas mask-wearing villain \"Blackdog\" and determines that the terrorist is targeting Do-Ryeong specifically. Forced to take a leave of absence for his own safety, Do-Ryeong worries about the uncertain future. If Blackdog could overpower him so easily, then there is nobody else the public can turn to for protection. By chance, Do-Ryeong meets a young woman named Park Rosa. Unbeknownst to him, she is the solution to his problem—in more ways than one.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
