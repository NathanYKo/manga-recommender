    "synopsis": "Link the Hero foretold that the Demon King would arise to obtain the Triforce for his nefarious desires, but his warning fell on deaf ears. Framed and imprisoned, he was left chained for four years. Yet the people returned, begging for his aid when his prophecy was revealed to be true. At the same time, the goddess Hylia descends riding a crimson Loftwing, a bird of the gods. She offers the people a way to escape into the skies, but Link vows to defeat the Demon King—no matter the cost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
