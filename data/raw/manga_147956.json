    "synopsis": "Miyabi always had dreams of being an architect, creating buildings that would inspire awe in others. And in the VMMORPG Yume Sekai, he was finally able to achieve that dream - even if his constructions were used entirely to house marriage proposals.\n\nOne day, Miyabi received a message from the admins of the game—as his architecture was so good for couples, they are gifting him with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go to a new world. Assuming they mean a private server, Miyabi accepts—and quickly gets transported to another world.\n\nAfter confirming that he was spirited away, Miyabi discovers that all of his crafting skills from the game are intact here. No longer tethered to his job in the real world, Miyabi now has a real goal: to build his own house and family.\n\n(Source: MU)",
