    "synopsis": "Yuma Chitose is a young and carefree child, until her parents are abruptly killed by a witch right before her eyes. Left distraught and traumatized at the scene, she is shielded from the same fatal fate by a magical girl named Kyouko Sakura. Having always felt weak, Yuma believes that becoming a magical girl is the only way for her to become stronger. But Kyouko dismisses the daunting idea, encouraging the young girl to live a normal life.\n\nYuma's curiosity, however, only flourishes when Kyuubey appears before her and tells her that Oriko Mikuni thinks she would make a good magical girl. But who is Oriko? And why has she taken an interest in Yuma? Meanwhile, magical girls are being targeted and killed. Rumor has it that the one hunting them is not a witch, but another magical girl.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
