    "synopsis": "Inusaki Nozomi has a secret power, but it's not a very useful one. In fact, it's downright annoying: he can talk to birds. In between doing odd jobs for those around him, he has to listen to the constant chatter of the gossiping sparrows outside of his window or the endless bickering of the pigeons in the park. He's just about at his wits' end with this unlucky power, when he encounters a crow–who for some reason knows his name.\n\n(Source: MU)",
