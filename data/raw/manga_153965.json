    "synopsis": "One day, as 20-year-old university student Sang-Woo was lazing about as usual, he ended up joining an awakening program, a system that allows even civilians to learn and use skills. Established a few years ago, the awakening program was advanced by the government, and now, the majority of citizens accept the system and end up awakening. Sang-Woo, too, entered the program without much thought, and thanks to it, gained the cloning skill.\n\nPeople around him thought this cloning skill only fooled the eyes by creating illusions, but after Sang-Woo realized it's a skill that doesn't create illusions but real bodies, he decided to become a hunter. Afterwards, in front of Sang-Woo, who was riding the wave of success with this skill, appeared Jumper George Lucas. Lucas, seeing Sang-Woo's cloning skill, felt a certain possibility, and took interest. Sang-Woo, who also felt a small piece of the massive plan Lucas was concocting, was unable to shake off the uneasiness he felt. Ultimately, Sang-Woo, who continued with his hunter activities, ended up learning of Lucas's plan and the true, dark secret behind it as well...\n\n(Source: MU)",
