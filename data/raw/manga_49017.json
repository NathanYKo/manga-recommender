    "synopsis": "High school can be a stressful time for many young people. The change means a new commute, new friends, new courses...new teachers. For Shino Oshima the change could have meant an opportunity to blossom into adulthood. Unfortunately, things go wrong on her first day - she fails to even say her name during her homeroom introduction. From then on Shino is a part-mute part-stuttering mess. Ostracized and afraid she struggles to find her place in this new world... But thankfully for her, she finds her voice through music and some unexpected new frienemies.\n\n(Source: Denpa)",
