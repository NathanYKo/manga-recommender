    "synopsis": "Ryouta Kajiyama is working hard as a new deliveryman for Kaizuka Delivery Services. His responsibilities include traveling to various apartments and carting packages to particular clients. But having just started his job, Kajiyama least expects to serve a man wearing a bunny head! As it turns out, the bunny—going by the name Mamoru Aizawa—is one of the company's loyal customers. Although he finds the man surreal, Kajiyama brushes his opinions off and resumes his usual day.\n\nDue to his frequent deliveries, Kajiyama develops a strong curiosity for the bunny-headed man. Musing about hidden identities, Aizawa may very well be a runaway convict—and the thought of it terrifies Kajiyama. However, he believes that the tall man is not tainted by evil at all. In truth, Aizawa timidly asks for him to return and continue to help with deliveries, bringing a smile to Kajiyama's face. The two seemingly have a smooth relationship blooming ahead of them, but what happens when a barefaced Aizawa appears out of nowhere?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots: Ano Egao wo Mou Ichido, Bokura no Saidai Kouyakusuu",
