    "synopsis": "In the town of Tokeizaka stands the old, worn-down boarding house known as Maison Ikkoku. For the last few years, the building has been home to a rambunctious group of tenants, including 20-year-old college applicant Yusaku Godai, its most recent resident. Recently, however, Yusaku has grown impatient with the noisy shenanigans interrupting his studies and has decided to move out. However, as he is preparing to leave, a beautiful woman named Kyoko Otonashi introduces herself as the new property manager. Falling in love with her at first sight, Yusaku changes his mind and decides to stay to court Kyoko instead.\n\nThough he initially believes he is making progress with Kyoko, Yusaku soon discovers that she is a widow still mourning the loss of her late husband. Despite her growing feelings for Yusaku, Kyoko states that she has no intentions to remarry or even date, as she still loves her late husband. Empathizing with her, Yusaku seeks to free Kyoko from her sadness with the help of the other inhabitants of Maison Ikkoku—all in the hope that she will one day see him as more than just another tenant of the building.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
