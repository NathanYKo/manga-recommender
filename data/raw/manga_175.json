    "synopsis": "Fairies in the hidden land of Gensokyo are natural pranksters and love to play tricks on humans and youkai alike. This fact is especially apparent for three fairies: Sunny Milk, Luna Child, and Star Sapphire. Having unique abilities that make them more powerful than the average fairy, they do almost anything they can to get a laugh out of their \"victims.\" However, considering that fairies are known as one of the weakest creatures around, their pranks are usually harmless. Even so, the rowdy trio's mischief is more than enough to bring trouble to anyone's day!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
