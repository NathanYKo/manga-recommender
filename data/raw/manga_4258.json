    "synopsis": "Born during the sunrise—an auspicious beginning—the Azumas' newborn son is named Hikaru, which means \"light.\" But during one play date, his mother notices that her son is slightly different from the other children. In this alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child's autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 15: Thank You Sensei!, Haru no Manazashi",
    "background": "In 2004, Hikari to Tomo ni...: Jiheishouji wo Kakaete won the 8th Japan Media Arts Festival's Award of Excellence in manga division, and was adapted into a live-action TV drama series. In 2010, after the author's death the last two unfinished chapters in their manuscripts format were published in the magazine, and later included in the last volume, deeming the series as incomplete. On the 30th anniversary since Tobe's debut in 2016, Kawasaki Mei drawn those two chapters concluding the story. The series was published in a 2-in-1 omnibus edition in English as With the Light... Raising an Autistic Child by Yen Press from September 24, 2007 to September 20, 2011.",
