    "synopsis": "Ever since she watched a sushi chef prepare fish with artistry and elegance, Hanayu Ashitaba has aspired to become one herself. However, as the daughter of a pâtissièr who is expected to inherit her father's business, her dream remains far out of reach. Nonetheless, Hanayu continues to persevere in hopes of finding a way to realize her goals. That is until she crosses paths with her classmate, Hayato Hyuuga.\n\nThe son of a sushi chef, Hyuuga is also destined to take over his father's business, but he is disinterested in doing so. Seeing this as an opportunity to marry into a sushi chef family, Hanayu begins devising a scheme to make Hyuuga fall in love with her. These efforts are quickly wasted when Hyuuga asks her out directly, stunning Hanayu while also making her second-guess using him as a means to an end. At the same time, Hyuuga seems to have a hidden agenda too—but what could it possibly be?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
