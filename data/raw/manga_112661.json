    "synopsis": "Daisuke Kaji does not like your typical gal. To the dutiful high school student, these girls are nothing but crude people who have no regard for anyone else. Daisuke does his best to avoid them, especially Chiriko Iega, whom he considers to be the most unrefined girl at his school.\n\nOne day, Daisuke finds himself evicted from his apartment due to his father's outstanding debts. His new arrangements send him to stay with the daughter of his father's friend—who is none other than Chiriko herself. However, the shock of having to live alone with a girl does not even compare to the shock he feels upon seeing the state of her house. Due to Chiriko's negligence in cleaning, her home has become unimaginably dirty, filled to the brim with trash. Fortunately for Chiriko, Daisuke happens to be an excellent cleaner.\n \nA one-man army in the field of sanitation, Daisuke has mastered all the chemical combinations and efficient methods necessary for quick and effective cleaning. On Chiriko's insistence, and to avoid living in squalor, Daisuke reluctantly agrees to clean the place with her. With a monumental task ahead of them, the pair work together through the mess—finding that as the house improves, so too does their relationship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
