    "synopsis": "Guk Yeonsu and Choi Wung are like oil and water—they simply do not mix. While Yeonsu's humble origins motivate her to tolerate no distractions from her studies, Wung was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and favors his peace of mind over any genuine effort. When they are paired up as subjects of a documentary that chronicles a month in the lives of two students—one at the top of the academic ranks and the other at the bottom—the filmmakers face challenges from the beginning. Wung embodies everything that Yeonsu loathes, and a middle ground seems unreachable. However, as they engage reluctantly for the cameras, they discover warm sides of one another that may bridge the bitter distance between them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
