But when he learns at the end of their time together that Taira and his mother are moving overseas, he’s shocked to receive a parting kiss and a vow that Taira won’t return—“until I’m taller than you, Azuma-san.” Four years later…and Taira’s back to make good on his promise.\n\n(Source: September Scanlations)",
