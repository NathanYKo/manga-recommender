    "synopsis": "When Han Iju married Jeong Sehyeok, it felt like a fairytale. After all, Iju is the heiress to a successful company and Sehyeok is the chauffeur's son. Sehyeok seemed like the perfect husband, always treating Iju with warmth and not caring about the difference in their stations. While Iju, reduced to living as a housewife with abusive in-laws, tolerated it all for her husband's sake. All that mattered was that they were together.\n\nHowever, when Iju discovers that Sehyeok is actually in love with her universally beloved sister Yura, things take a tragic turn. Fleeing the scene of her husband's confession in shock, Iju is fatally struck by a car, and the last thing she sees is Sehyeok covering Yura's eyes instead of rushing to her side.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Iju opens her eyes to find herself transported exactly one year into her past, just before her marriage to Sehyeok. This unexpected second chance is also an opportunity to exact revenge on all those who brought her to ruin the first time. So this time, Iju plans to play the game the way that everyone else does—and win.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
