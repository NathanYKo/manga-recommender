    "synopsis": "Artezia \"Tia\" Rosan has always lived for the sake of her half-brother, Laurence. Her capricious mother has never failed to remind her who she owes her life to; Tia earns shallow love and attention by devising wicked schemes and manipulating Laurence's rivals for the throne. Laurence is eventually crowned emperor, but he soon betrays and savagely imprisons Tia, leaving her to bear the weight of their collective sins alone.\n\nTia awaits a pitiful death befitting a villainess, until she is strangely rescued by a man supposed to despise her—Grand Duke Cedric Ebron. Although many of Tia's crimes are unforgivable, Cedric implores her to switch sides and save the nation from its new, heartless emperor. Tia sees but one solution: sacrificing herself to magically rewind time and give Cedric a chance to prevent Laurence's victory.\n\nHowever, Tia does not die. Instead, she is the one who awakens two years in the past. Armed with memories of the future, Tia relies on Cedric and her cunning talents to unshackle herself from her doomed family and protect the empire.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
