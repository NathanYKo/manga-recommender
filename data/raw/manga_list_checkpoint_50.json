        "synopsis": "In 1924, mountaineers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine attempted a daring challenge: to be the first to scale Mount Everest. However, they disappeared during the final stages of their trek, leading to one of mountaineering's greatest mysteries—did the pair ever make it to the summit?\n\n1993, Kathmandu. Japanese photographer Makoto Fukamachi discovers a vintage camera in an antique store, which he believes might have belonged to Mallory. However, the camera falls into the possession of \"Bikha Sanp,\" a burly Japanese man who Fukamachi realizes may very well be Jouji Habu, a legendary Japanese mountaineer who disappeared from the scene several years ago. Unfortunately for Fukamachi however, Bikha Sanp refuses to talk to him and leaves with the camera in tow.\n\nWith the trail gone cold, Fukamachi has only one course left to pursue: to delve into Habu's past and see just what may have brought the former climber to Nepal. For the sake of rewriting mountaineering history, Fukamachi begins his investigation, a task that will bring him to the greatest height in the world—the summit of the gods.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "On her 16th birthday, Himari Momochi receives a letter stating she has inherited a mansion called the Momochi House. Having been raised in an orphanage, this mansion is the only thing left of her real family, so Himari pays no mind to the rumors that it may be haunted. Upon entering it, she meets Aoi Nanamori and his companions, Ise and Yukari, who all seem to be squatting in her new home. Although they warn her to leave the house, Himari vows to be the one to make them leave instead.\n\nBut soon, she is attacked by youkai and finds out that the house sits in the space between the world of the living and the spirit realm. Even more surprising, Aoi was chosen to be the guardian of the house—a position originally meant for Himari. But this great power came with an awful price: Aoi can never leave the mansion, and his existence in the human world has been erased. Ignoring his pleas for her to leave the mansion, Himari promises to help Aoi break the housebound curse as she begins living under the same roof as him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He has no friends and isn't even interested in any of the girls he knows. He's also teased due to the fact that he loves shoujo manga. Unlike the harem daydreams of his peers, he dreams of finding his true love. Unfortunately, a shinigami comes to kill him, simply because he's a \"forever alone\" sort of guy. When he gasps out his intention of embracing life with his final breaths, though, she takes it back! As long as he follows through on his intentions, he won't be killed.\n\nTo convince the shinigami that his plans are genuine, he declares that he will confess to the girl he likes, the very next day. Expecting failure with confessing to random girls in his school, he sends out love letters to four different girls. To his surprise, they all agree to be his girlfriend. Now, this shoujo-manga-loving guy has ended up in a kind of harem story, quadruple-timing four girls! Will he be able to stay involved enough with society to avoid an early death?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",

        "synopsis": "Mai Taniyama's school has an ancient, abandoned, and allegedly cursed building. Whenever it is about to be torn down, a series of unsettling deaths occur and halt the demolition. To prove it is haunted, Mai and her friends try to summon a specter by telling ghost stories. No ghosts appear, but the group encounters Kazuya Shibuya, a 17-year-old transfer student. Though her friends are charmed by Kazuya's attractive looks and great manners, Mai does not trust him.\n\nFollowing a mishap, Mai discovers Kazuya's real identity as the president of Shibuya Psychic Research, a group hired by the school principal to investigate the building's rumored paranormal activity. As a consequence of her actions, Mai must temporarily help Kazuya if she does not want to pay him damages. Joined by other individuals experienced with the supernatural—former Buddhist monk Houshou Takigawa, self-proclaimed Shinto priestess Ayako Matsusaki, famous medium Masako Hara, and Catholic priest John Brown—Mai and Kazuya must uncover the mystery surrounding the building before any more innocent lives are lost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, she one day finds herself in the midst of a scene from one of these games as the story's villainess, Aileen Lauren Dautriche.\n\nAt the banquet to celebrate the end of the academy's winter term, the crown prince and Aileen's childhood friend, Cedric Jeanne Elmir, publicly annuls his engagement with Aileen and announces that he is in love with Lilia Rainworth, the game's female protagonist. Aware of the tragic future ahead of her and determined to change it, the young girl resolves to conquer the game's final boss, the \"Demon King\" and Cedric's half-brother, Claude Jeanne Elmir, by making him fall in love with her instead.\n\nWith time running out, can Irene succeed with her plans, or will she remain bound to the ill-fated ending that awaits her?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nothing is off the table from fighting one-on-one duels to large battle royales—not even death.

Susceptible to prejudice and discrimination because of their scarlet eyes, they remain hidden from the general public, letting only a distinct few clan members venture outside.\n\nBut after helping Sheila—a woman who found herself stranded in the forest—Kurapika and his best friend Pyro become fascinated with the outside world. In order to achieve his dreams of exploring life beyond the forest, Kurapika must pass the clan elder's three tests in order to be granted permission.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But that is just the beginning of Rintaro's story, as he finds himself unexpectedly in Hell where he meets his guide, the painfully sexy devil Koyori. Can Rintaro take his situation seriously enough to repent for the sins of his former life or is he fated to be eternally tempted, teased, and tortured by scantily-clad devils with iron spiked clubs?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

Betrayed, Kaito was consumed by one thought: revenge. With this will, a system message announced that the Holy Sword of Vengeance activated, and time began to rewind—all the way to when he was first summoned to this other world.\n\nThis time, Kaito won't be a fool. He won't fall for their lies and platitudes. He will return every inch of pain they inflicted on him and carve it deep in their hearts so they never forget his name. They will regret using him; after all, he will not give them the satisfaction of a quick death. Even if they plead, beg, or cry, Kaito will only laugh. There is no respite from his beautiful and bloody path of revenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "William Twining is one of Stratford School's top students, but despite attending a religious school, he does not believe in God or the supernatural because he is an emphatic realist and a proponent of modern science.\n\nAlthough the Twinings are one of Britain's most prestigious noble families, William's missing uncle accumulated a lot of debt. One day, desperate to find anything valuable in his manor that he can sell to pay this debt, William stumbles upon a secret room in which a stranger inexplicably appears. This intruder introduces himself as Dantalion, Grand Duke of Hell. \n\nDantalion claims that William is the \"elector\" who can choose the representative Emperor of Hell, and furthermore, this authority is inherited only by descendants of the ancient wise king Solomon. William's mindset does not allow for the existence of Heaven or Hell, so naturally he denounces Dantalion as a fraud and declines to support his candidacy for Emperor. However, the demon refuses to take no for an answer, even if he must enroll at Stratford as \"Dantalion Huber\" in order to stay near the elector and convince him. How can William fend off this unwelcome hanger-on, and the others that are sure to follow?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "High school student council president Hotaru Tachibana—a girl often confused as a boy due to her speech pattern and clothing—is not afraid to fight against injustice. When her friend is supposedly swindled by a host, Hotaru feels compelled to confront the man responsible. He turns out to be her next-door-neighbor, Masamune Matsuoka, who decides that the best way to settle this is to play a \"survival game\": an imaginary war game where fake guns are used, but the battles are no less real.\n\nDespite Hotaru's best efforts, she ends up losing and incurring a large debt due to the resulting damages. Consequently, she is forced to become the third member of Masamune's male-only team \"Toy ☆ Gun Gun,\" joining his friend, Tooru Yukimura, an author of adult manga who dislikes her at first. However, before she even notices it, Hotaru becomes genuinely fond of both the sport and her team members. She chooses to share in their dream of becoming the best survival game team in Japan and winning the famous tournament, Top Combat Game, even if that means hiding her identity as a girl from her teammates.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
