    "synopsis": "George Zanuff is an educated owner of a neighborhood grocery store... but he is also a killer with a propensity to maim beautiful women. Zanuff suffers knowing that he is a monster, so every day he feels his thirst for blood begging him to slice his female clients. However, he battles hard every day to control his murderous instincts and lead an honest life even rejected by his own family. But all that changes when he meets a lost little girl named Alice...\n\nKaitai Zanuff is a one-shot about a killer who knows perfectly the monster that he is, and how love is capable of redemption.\n\n(Source: Yadon Scans, translated)",
