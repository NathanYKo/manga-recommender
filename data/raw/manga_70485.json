Itsuki is about to go in for the kill when a gigantic beast appears out of nowhere, snatching up the wolf in its jaws and sucking the life out of it. The beast that stared Itsuki down was a gargantuan, blood-sucking vampire deer... Will the two brothers be able to return to the village alive?!\n\n(Source: Manga Box)",
