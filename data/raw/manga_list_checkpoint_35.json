But now that she is a first year student at Shoubi Academy, Anís considers it to be more of a curse than a blessing. She cannot remove it no matter how hard she tries, and due to its presence, she receives constant attention from the rest of the school.\n\nOne day, a bat-like creature appears out of nowhere and crashes into Anís' head. During its escape, an elegant red rose card is left behind and her choker goes missing. Reminded that a severe punishment awaits her should she ever take it off, Anís frantically begins to search for the lost item. This search leads her to learn that she is the Rose Princess, the sovereign of four Rose Knights: Kaede Higa, the offensive Red Rose; Mitsuru Tenjou, the defensive White Rose; Seiran Asagi, the alchemy-skilled Blue Rose, and Mutsuki Kurama, the discovery-centered Black Rose. They are all the most popular boys at her school, and with only a kiss to their respective cards, Anís can now summon their presence and magical abilities!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Taisuke Kanou is your average 16-year-old student. He has two close friends, Hirose and Megumi. Hirose has trouble with bullies, but Taisuke is always there to defend him, even though he just winds up getting beaten instead of Hirose. During class one day, Taisuke is hit by something unworldly and for that split second, he sees a vision of the universe. As he's walking home from school, he sees a girl fall and die in front of him, but his first thought is jealousy. He later finds out that the strange sensation that hit him is spreading throughout Japan. Those who are struck by it either commit suicide or \"evolve,\" but the comrades that evolve usually have dark intentions for the rest of the world.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "Famed horror manga artist Junji Itou loves nothing more than to stand and admire the fresh white wallpaper, gleaming floors, and smell of his brand-new house. But his happiness is short-lived when his fiancée, A-ko, reminds him of her plan to bring her cat Yon into their new abode. As an avid dog person, Junji experiences chills down his spine whenever he recalls Yon's uncanny face and a seeming skull on his furry coat. When A-ko also decides to adopt another cat, Muu, to keep Yon company, he fears that all hell will break loose.\n\nWith Yon and Muu's arrival, the wallpaper is quickly covered in shiny, protective sheets; the floor is marred with scratches; and the stench of the litter box hangs heavy in the air. The two cats become quick friends, and—to Junji's surprise—endear themselves to the new cat owner as well. As they grow closer, the manga artist begins to believe that living with cats may not be so bad after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But after one disastrous attempt, they began relying on food from convenience stores instead. While flower-viewing, Kouhei and Tsumugi run into Kotori Iida, one of Kouhei's socially awkward students. Once she spots Tsumugi trying to take a bite out of her lunch, Kotori invites them to her mother's restaurant.\n\nIn an attempt to feed Tsumugi something delicious, Kouhei barges into the restaurant in the middle of the night—only to find Kotori waiting for them and willing to help him in the kitchen. Although Kotori is as helpless as Kouhei when it comes to cooking, the two manage to make a simple dish. It turns out that, due to her mom's job, Kotori has been eating dinner alone for a long time. For the sake of Tsumugi's happiness, Kouhei promises her and Kotori that they will all eat together—thus marking the first of many sweet moments while sharing meals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Dedicated Huntsmen and Huntresses battle Grimm with both customized weapons and their own Semblances, unique abilities derived from the energy of one's soul. Some warriors also utilize a crystallized energy propellant, Dust, to bestow their weapons with elemental properties. In this dangerous line of work, rigorous training is required to stay alive. To that end, each of Remnant's four Kingdoms have established schools to properly groom children holding aspirations of becoming licensed Huntsmen.\n\nAt Beacon Academy in the Kingdom of Vale, a promising group of future Huntresses make their debut as Team RWBY. Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long each come from different backgrounds and often butt heads as a result. However, when they cooperate, they are a formidable force who have even attracted the attention of Beacon's headmaster Professor Ozpin. Alongside fellow students such as those in Team JNPR, the young prodigy Ruby and her friends engage in adventures that pit them against an extremist Faunus group known as the White Fang. Every explosive encounter also brings them closer to the true villains orchestrating conflicts from the shadows.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite busy work schedules and their age difference, their love for each other never wavers.\n\nBe it frisky fights over who ate the last pudding or serious conversations about their future together, Yuuya and Rio still find themselves nervous and bashful around each other, reminiscent of the early days of their relationship. Yet their adorable everyday dynamic is nothing short of the joy and giddiness of a couple's true love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, he despises the Akagami way of life and vows to rescind the infamy of his family by staying celibate. But as fate would have it, Akemitsu falls in love at first sight on his way home from work one day. Unable to erase his feelings that are spiraling out of control, he resorts to his final measure—to practice as a monk and seal away his worldly desires.\n\nHoping to put his past behind him, Akemitsu travels to the nearest temple in order to receive Buddhist training. But fate tempts him once again: greeting him at the door is the girl he had fallen madly in love with, who lives in the very temple he wishes to train in.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Publicly challenging his father to a revenge bout for the title of \"World's Strongest,\" Baki sets out to train himself even further. He targets the few men who are said to hold comparable power to Yuujirou, including the \"Unchained\" bounty hunter Biscuit Olivia and a prehistoric human named Pickle revived from the Mesozoic era.\n\nThe demonic Yuujirou monitors his son's training with a growing anticipation. The \"Ogre\" sees Baki as little more than a savory meal marinating for him to devour. Still, Yuujirou exists in solitude at the top of the mountain of strength. He yearns for a combatant to rise up and prove themselves a worthy opponent capable of giving him a challenge. Despite viewing his son as pathetic, Yuujirou can't help but hope his child will be the one to give him the thrill of equal combat he has lived so long without.\n\nAs Baki seeks to understand his father's monstrous legacy, Yuujirou comes to terms with his true feelings toward his son. The two Hanmas advance toward their climactic fight to decide who is really the \"World's Strongest.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Blessed with great fortune since his childhood, he grew up wanting nothing but affection from his oftentimes distant family.\n\nAfter losing his mother and crippling his dominant arm in an accident, Tamahiko fell into deep despair and was cast aside by his own father for his handicap. Condemned to live isolated in the countryside where he would not bring shame to his family's name, he resigned himself to dying alone—until one day, a young girl named Yuzuki Tachibana appeared on his doorstep, proclaiming that Tamahiko's father sent her to be his bride.\n\nAs she takes care of Tamahiko, Yuzuki brings a feeling of springtime into Tamahiko's dreary life, allowing him to gradually heal from the deep emotional scars of his youth. Their lives slowly intertwine as both Tamahiko and Yuzuki taste the fruits of their first love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After his untimely death, Kazuma finds himself standing before Aqua—the self-proclaimed water goddess who presents him two with choices: to ascend to heaven or reincarnate in a real fantasy world. Picking the latter, Kazuma gets tasked with defeating the Demon King, an occurring threat in his new world. However, Aqua's provocative attitude strikes a nerve, and in the heat of the moment, Kazuma takes her along.\n\nKazuma and Aqua, now stuck together in another world, embark on a journey. They soon acquire two more companions: Megumin, an archwizard wielding devastating explosion magic; and Lalatina \"Darkness\" Dustiness Ford, a crusader with a worrisome case of masochism. The four of them form an odd party, each member contributing their unique share of power and a peculiar personality. Unfortunately, their adventure soon proves to be challenging and costly, Kazuma's new life may be nothing but a headache.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Up until now, his only insight into urban affairs was through an anonymous online group chat, where he found out about Ikebukuro's renowned legend. It says that a headless biker known only as the \"Black Rider\" roams Ikebukuro, executing its own justice against criminals.\n\nBut the district's quirks do not end there; Ikebukuro is swarming with so-called color gangs and their ceaseless conflicts. Among them, a colorless gang known as the Dollars is most noteworthy, as its founder, members, and numbers are all unknown. With odd cliques at every turn and uncanny tales coming to life, humans seem to mix with the supernatural, and Mikado soon dives into the deep sea of Ikebukuro's myths, deceits, and carefully planned out crises—a dangerous world, but possibly one where he belongs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the present day, the emperor and his four sons reign over the country with an iron fist. It is said that only the prophesied \"Child of Destiny\" can free Japan from the royal family's shackles.\n\nSarasa is the twin sister of Tatara, the Child of Destiny. Despite having to live in her brother's shadow, Sarasa supports him in any way she can. However, tragedy strikes when the Red King, the emperor's youngest son, and his army attack her village, leading to Tatara's brutal death. To protect the townspeople, Sarasa takes on her brother's name and becomes the Child of Destiny, vowing revenge on the Red King.\n\nWith the sudden turn of events taking a toll on her health, Sarasa visits a hot spring to recuperate. During her stay, she meets Shuri, a charming yet mysterious young man. Shuri is fascinated by Sarasa as she treats him differently from other girls; meanwhile, Sarasa is unable to stop thinking about him. This casual encounter between the two seals their fate—destined to be bound by war, hatred, and love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To fulfill his viewers' neverending fantasies, BJ Alex—who wears a mask to conceal his face—performs sensually arousing acts. Most of the time, Dong-Gyun ends up indulging in sexual pleasure after watching the steamy show. Being in blissful ignorance, he has fallen in love with the gay cam boy.\n\nAt school, Dong-Gyun meets Ahn Jiwon, the amiable and radiant president of the student council. When he invites Dong-Gyun to a drinking party, it quickly ends in total failure as Dong-Gyun becomes extremely intoxicated. In the company of Jiwon, he arrives safely in his apartment.\n\nWhile his colleague cleans himself from the bumpy ride, Dong-Gyun fixes his eyes on Jiwon's half-naked body; his physique resembles that of BJ Alex's! Unable to contain his excitement, Dong-Gyun asks if he and BJ Alex are the same person—the response he gets is unexpected. With a different side of Jiwon exposed, Dong-Gyun will never be able to look at him the same way ever again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, his ability to create delicious dishes unknown to this world soon pays dividends, even attracting the legendary wolf Fenrir.

        "synopsis": "Individuals with Momotarou and Oni blood coursing through their veins maintain a longstanding rivalry. The Oni are careless, rash, and disorderly, while the Momotarou protect the human world from the uncontrollable Oni. Shiki Ichinose is a reckless and irresponsible teenager, aware of his defiance and even proud of his expulsion from school. Despite Shiki's rebellious attitude, his foster father, Tsuyoshi, cares about him deeply.\n\nTsuyoshi's selfless love is soon shown in an explosive incident when a Momotarou barges in looking for Shiki. As a Momotarou himself, Tsuyoshi has been hiding Shiki for years and keeping his Oni origins a secret even from him. As he gives up his life to save Shiki and confesses everything in his dying breath, Shiki's Oni blood awakens for the first time, transforming him into an unruly monster overflowing with rage and a thirst for revenge.\n\nShiki's momentary outburst attracts the attention of Naito Mudano, an Oni teacher at the Rakshasa Academy—an institution for young Oni in need of understanding and perfecting their powers. Before Shiki can avenge his father, he must learn to control his headstrong and impulsive nature and, above all, fight against his own demonic blood.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though Jin eventually makes a contract with the god Solderet and is freed from the curse that hindered his abilities, he meets a rather unfortunate end. In the next moment, however, he awakens as a baby, long before his tragedy began. Armed with a second chance and some new powers, Jin swears to fulfill his destiny and become the ultimate swordmaster.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",

Now she is entering middle school and her only friend, Yawara Kai, is attending a different school. This leaves Bocchi alone, surrounded by new classmates with whom she must make friends before Kai will talk to her again.\n\n(Source: Dynasty Scans)",

However, Medea's ambitious scheme collapses when the crown prince chooses naive Psyche Callista as his fiancée instead of her. As a result, she resolves to remove Psyche by any means necessary and secure her place on the throne.\n\nHowever, not all goes according to her plan. At the Yearly Prayer held in the Temple, Medea confronts Psyche and her ignorance toward possessing unfathomable authority. In an instant, Medea falls into a seemingly bottomless fountain, unable to reach the surface. Believing that God is responsible, she prays to be the one who rules the empire.\n\nThe deity grants Medea's wish at the cost of exchanging bodies with Psyche, a twist of fate that may reveal more than what meets the eye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When Shou arrives at school that morning, an earthquake of mysterious origin strikes, and the campus is teleported to an empty wasteland, far removed from society. Not only do Shou and his peers face an immediate crisis of food shortage, they must also contend with other problems, including new and dangerous external threats, and rising conflict among the student body. With the adults having a hard time adjusting, Shou finds the immense responsibility to quickly adapt to his new dystopian reality a heavy burden on his small shoulders.\n\nWritten by the horror specialist Kazuo Umezu, Hyouryuu Kyoushitsu is regarded as a classic in its genre—a unique blend of the riveting mystery behind the entrapment of Shou and his classmates on the barren, hostile world, and their struggle for survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ignoring the event as some sort of attempted religious soliciting, Seiji closes the door and walks away, only to find that Guri can phase right through it!\n\nGuri wields a \"Kiss Note,\" a powerful magical notebook that can cause two people to instantly fall in love if their names are written in it. As a cupid, it is Guri's duty to use the notebook to create couples. And as it turns out, she accidentally wrote Seiji's name in the book, forcing him to complete the pair by finding someone to kiss.\n\nAt a loss for words, Seiji believes Guri's ridiculous story and kisses his crush Akane Hiyama, the school's most popular girl. But Akane's feelings for Seiji go far beyond what would be considered normal, and she develops an obsession with him. As if things couldn't get more ludicrous, Guri announces that she also harbors feelings for him, marking the start of Seiji's chaotic and comedic love life. Will either girl be able to win Seiji's affection, or will their personal lives interrupt their dreams?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Luckily, the timely intervention of Prince Kail saves Yuri from the queen's grasp. Kail promises to send Yuri back to her home, but the queen's persistent schemes to kill them both, plus their growing feelings for each other, keep those plans delayed.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 28: Orontes Renka",

Sid wants to be someone just like that more than anything, and something as insignificant as boring reality isn't going to get in his way! He trains in secret every single night, preparing for his eventual rise to power—only to denied his destiny by a run-of-the-mill (yet deadly) traffic accident. But when he wakes up in a another world and suddenly finds himself at the head of an actual secret organization doing battle with evil in the shadows, he'll finally get a chance to act out all of his delusional fantasies!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

She treasures the place she calls home, an orphanage in Hokkaido called Lavender House, as well as its owner, Hagio. But as much as Hagio and the fellow orphans love her, Najika decides to leave the orphanage to attend a special academy in Tokyo, hoping to achieve her dreams of being a pastry chef.\n\nHowever, Najika has another reason for leaving for the academy. She hopes to find the boy she calls the \"Flan Prince\"—a boy who touched her heart with a cup of flan seven years ago. Now 13 years old, Najika finds that the spoon that he left behind with the flan shares its emblem with the school she has been accepted to—the prestigious Seika Academy.\n\nWith high hopes, Najika enters her school's beautiful campus and becomes a first-year student in Seika's junior high division. While unpopular with her fellow classmates due to her love of eating, she seems to find support from two boys who recognize her culinary talents—the popular brothers Daichi and Sora Kitazawa. Will Najika be able to find her place in the academy with her cooking, and perhaps also reunite with her Flan Prince?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "For those who've killed as much as Kuroko Koumori, there is no doubt that they've lost their sanity. In fact, by proving that she is still sane even after killing as many as 715 people, Kuroko avoids death row. Now given a second chance to remain in society as a State-Appointed Executioner, Kuroko and a girl named Hinako Tozakura are charged with hunting down other killers.\n\nWhile Hinako is a rather happy-go-lucky girl that drives ferraris without a care for the rules of the road (or gravity, for that matter), Kuroko—who Hinako affectionately addresses as \"Kuu-chan\"—is more of a lascivious lesbian with razor sharp instincts and an impressive aptitude for murder.\n\nThe two seem like the most unlikely of duos. However, saddled with the gruesome job of ridding the country of vicious serial killers, it only makes sense for the executioners to be anything but normal!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Pilot film of Murciélago",

Now that the suspension is over, the only club's members left are interested only in women, smoking and doing nothing until, under professor Kawato's guidance, they discover a new dream called Koushien. The road to Koushien is far from easy, as they have to get back in shape, to learn how to play baseball and to win everyone else mistrust, including the principal's and other professor's one, with only a few months available. Sweating and fighting, the baseball club will find his determination and strength, as they proceed towards their dreams, while Kawato's enthusiastic and non-conventional ways slowly change the attitude of everyone near them.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Togawa's prickly exterior definitely puts the rookie recruit on-edge, but it doesn't take long before Shima's every waking thought is invaded by his overbearing yet totally thoughtful superior. Will Shima put aside a history of disappointment in order to take a chance on a complicated relationship?\n\nNo Touching at All breaks every rule in the office handbook in the name of mixed signals, shared memories, and the sweet surrender of an after-hours liaison! Shima and Togawa butt heads both at work and in the bedroom... but their inexplicable chemistry is far too intense to ignore. Can these two men forget their painful pasts and move forward hand-in-hand?\n\n(Source: Juné)",

        "synopsis": "University student Umi Asagi generously receives both presents and confessions from Kamibukuro-kun—a stranger who always wears a paper bag over his head. Despite his overly timid demeanor, he endlessly pursues the woman he loves most, following her anywhere she goes. However, her best friend views Kamibukuro-kun as a nuisance and his love as a stalking obsession. Ultimately, her companion strikes terror into Kamibukuro-kun, threatening him never to go near Umi again.\n\nLike Umi's friend had hoped, Kamibukuro-kun vanishes into thin air. But all this time, Umi never believed that his acts caused her trouble; in truth, she looks forward to seeing his presence every day. When Umi backs herself into a corner, will Kamibukuro-kun come to her rescue?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To add more confusion to his sadness, all information regarding his younger brother as a student in Germany have been erased systematically, as if he never existed. Meanwhile in Japan, a half-German, half-Japanese boy named Adolf Kauffmann and his best friend, a Jewish-German boy named Adolf Kamil, were accidentally involved in this incident. Their lives and fates are now inevitably interwoven around the biggest secret of the third Adolf—Adolf Hitler.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "High school student Hitori \"Bocchi\" Gotou has no social life or any friends—unless you count her guitar. She dreams of creating a school band in the hopes that using her instrument will elevate her social standing. However, despite spending the last two years diligently practicing guitar, she is no closer to her goal.\n\nAlthough she has gained a following online for her guitar covers of popular songs, Bocchi's lack of social skills means that her dream may ultimately be impossible. But one day, drummer Nijika Ijichi spots Bocchi with her guitar alone in a park. Desperately in need of a guitarist, Nijika quickly recruits Bocchi to the band that Nijika has formed with bassist Ryou Yamada—Kessoku Band. Though overwhelmed and left floundering at the sudden social interaction, Bocchi realizes this may be the start of something bigger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, she wakes up from her dream only to find herself in a sinking ship, being rescued by three strangers: Arashi Aota, whose kind-hearted personality does not match his quick temper; Semimaru Asai, who enjoys ridiculing Natsu's meek nature; and Botan Saotome, a skillful woman seemingly aware of their situation. Following the four's successful escape, they sail to a deserted island.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the mysterious island is Japan. After a meteorite landed on Earth, humanity was wiped out and the environment changed drastically. To repopulate the country, the government initiated the \"7 Seeds\" project, consisting of five groups—Spring, Summer A, Summer B, Autumn, and Winter—each with seven young healthy individuals and a guide. Natsu and the others were put into team Summer B, whose members are considered failures by society.\n\nTo get more supplies, the group must find one of the seven shelters built by the government. In a hostile, unfamiliar world with no loved ones to depend on, the quartet must learn to cooperate with each other to ensure their survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But behind her cute facade lies the soul of a ruthless salaryman who challenged \"Being X\"—the self-proclaimed God who reincarnated the man into an industrial world of magic. By doing this, Being X hopes to prove that, if the situation were dire enough, even a non-believer like this man would pray for God's help.\n\nOpposing Being X's desires to make her suffer, Tanya enlists in the military with the hope of living a peaceful life. She manages to impress the higher-ups with her aptitude for war, swiftly rising through the ranks. However, her country soon participates in the ongoing world war, quickly crushing her dream. In an attempt to return to her calm she starts using any merciless means to obliterate her opponents. Thus begins the saga of Tanya the Evil and the Empire as they seek world domination.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although she and her husband, Emperor Sovieshu, are not as intimate as other couples, their trust in each other has been built over years of friendship. But then, wanting something more, he brings in a concubine—a former slave named Rashta—and that is when everything begins to fall apart.\n\nMonths later, the fateful day arrives; Sovieshu declares his intentions to divorce Navier and give her throne to Rashta. However, against all expectations, Navier is not backed against a wall, and she declares her intention to marry another man—Heinrey—whose noble appearance shocks all in the room. \n\nJust who is Heinrey, and how did Navier come to this new marriage arrangement? The Eastern Nation stands at a precipice, being torn apart by conspiracies, lies, and—above all—love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With no qualifications and little experience for her age, all of her job interviews have been unfruitful. Despite this, she continues to splurge on expensive gifts for her young \"boyfriend\" in the hopes that her romantic interest will someday marry and support her. Eventually, Shibata finds out that her feelings are one-sided, for her boyfriend has been lying and using her for money.\n\nAt the lowest point of her life, she unexpectedly reunites with Ayumu Kurosawa, her strict former boss whom she resents. Feeling responsible for her unemployment, Kurosawa agrees to help Shibata and once again becomes her employer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Middle school student Eijun Sawamura has just lost his final baseball game after pitching a unique fastball that cost Akagi Middle School their chance to reach the nationals. As the baseball team captain, he feels responsible for their enormous loss and vows to take his friends there in high school. However, with his terrible grades and no school recommendations in his area, Sawamura sulks as he tries to figure out how to keep his promise.\n\nHis pitch during the last game catches the attention of a scout from the prestigious Seidou High School in Tokyo, who soon convinces a begrudging Sawamura to observe their school's nationally-ranked baseball team practice. At Seidou, an impromptu competition between Sawamura and one of their batters causes him to cross paths with Kazuya Miyuki—a catcher who can pull out Sawamura's strengths as a pitcher.\n\nThe experience he has accumulated at Seidou changes his initial reluctance to transfer to Tokyo. Although he still feels guilt over betraying his friends, they encourage him to take the offer and enroll in Seidou. Filled with a renewed sense of determination, Sawamura begins the arduous journey of becoming Seidou's team ace and heading for the nationals while carrying the spirit of his former school with him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Surrounded by attractive men all vying for her attention would be any maiden's dream—but that is not the case for Rae! None of them can hold a candle to the villainess, Claire François, whose blonde, drill-shaped ringlets only accentuate her haughty irresistible charm.\n\nIn the original story, Claire harasses and bullies the heroine, which drives the latter closer to the male love interests. But Rae has no intention of pursuing any of the men; her heart is set on Claire herself! Unused to being on the receiving end of affection, Claire is left at the mercy of Rae's endless teasing. With the power of true love, can Rae successfully convey her heartfelt feelings to the villainess?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Yuuma Azawa is a transfer student with an odd habit: he cannot stop apologizing. Taking pity on him, Keiko Arisu, his new classmate, insists he should stop, but all Yuuma responds with is a string of apologies. The bizarre encounters continue when Keiko notices a strange girl following her, eerily proclaiming that she wants to suck her brains out. Running in fear, Keiko jumps in a truck's way and ends up hospitalized.\n\nYuuma pays Keiko a visit in the hospital and confesses that the girl she met is his younger sister, Chizumi. Befriending Chizumi, Keiko discovers Yuuma's dark past: he once summoned the devil and became obsessed, profusely apologizing as a form of a wicked offering.\n\nStill freaked out, Keiko returns to school; however, everyone’s brains terrifyingly melt out of their skulls—and according to Chizumi, it is Yuuma's apologies that caused it. Keiko manages to escape before meeting the same fate, but miseries and misfortune that would befall those around the demonic siblings seem like just the beginning.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots: Saikai, Daichi no Ko",

After seeing her undress, feelings of affection begin to blossom within Kanba, despite Fujiyama being considered unattractive by both peers and passersby. Kanba asks her out on an impulse and—to his surprise—she says yes.\n\nThrough school events, fireworks festivals, and more, Kanba juggles gawking at his new girlfriend and keeping their relationship a secret. This is no easy task for the less-than-popular Kanba, as Fujiyama often draws the eyes of all around her.\n\nFuijyama-san wa Shishunki follows the pair as they stumble hand-in-hand through many lighthearted, comedic situations and gradually learn more about young love and each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When he returns to school the next day, he finds that the girl has shown the video to the entire class over LINE. Amid the jeering of his classmates, she snidely apologizes to him and explains that his video was hilarious enough to warrant sharing.\n\nHowever, his decision to remove the upload is curbed after a ghost is spotted within the video, and a classmate advises against its deletion. His YouTube post eventually gains popularity as the growing audience discovers more anomalies, all intent on deciphering the hidden messages that its very uploader had not even intended.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The government gives only one ostensible reason for the act’s purpose—to spread the value of life.\n \nKengo Fujimoto is a newly instated Ikigami messenger who is indecisive on his stance of the act. Curbing his hesitation to avoid the watchful eye of the national police, Kengo decides that delivering the Ikigami will help shape his opinion. \n\nIkigami follows how people act knowing that their final hours are upon them.

Along with the unknown reasons for his reincarnation came the uneasy reality of having to coexist with demons. He was faced with a world that made him question everything he had believed in. Gifted with this extraordinary body since birth, as Eugene, he begins walking down the unfinished path from his previous life.\n\n(Source: KW Books, translated)",

In accordance with this, Airi Hoshina strictly follows her routine in preparation for her dream life: to have a loving, wholesome husband and family. However, Airi's life takes a fantastical turn when a young boy appears from her hand mirror.\n\nNamed Aram Astale Ei Daemonia Eucalystia, the young prince of Astale is fleeing his kingdom to evade a magical spell. Unknowingly, his portal leads directly to Airi's hand mirror. Though he avoided the brunt of the spell, his escape did not completely save him from the magic's effects: a spell that was originally supposed to turn Aram into an old man instead ages his body to that of a 17-year-old whenever it is dark. Now, the only way to turn him back is a kiss from his beloved maiden. Busy trying to find her one true love, Airi wants nothing to do with it, but Aram insists his soulmate must be her!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Realtor Reiko Kujirai, however, craves for the new and exciting places in the area. In contrast, her only coworker, Hajime Kudou, enjoys the nostalgia the city invokes and is put off by anything modern that seeps past its walls. But despite their differing views and constant bickering on the most mundane of things, the two often find themselves enjoying each other's company.\n\nOne day, a prank gone wrong leads Hajime to make an unexpected advance toward Reiko, after which he swiftly apologizes for. Baffled by his actions, Reiko starts investigating for possible explanations, only to discover a past that she has no memory of.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "This is a story. A story about choices and consequences, confessions resulting in love and rejection, and decisions leading to sacrifice and tragedy.\n\nKoyomi Araragi's decision to save a blonde vampire and meddle with the supernatural resulted in his death as a human and rebirth as a monster. But this was only one of the countless tragedies and choices that Koyomi would be faced with, and he is confronted with the fact that his seemingly unshakeable and hard-earned relationships do not last. As strange oddities continue to manifest in the world around him, he is faced with impossible choices—to sever his ties with those he loves, or eternally remain a part of the world of monsters and apparitions and watch the world crumble as a result. To accept or reject a confession, and sacrifice his all for the sake of others. However, both of these paths could lead to tragedy and farewells.\n\nThis is a story. A story about Koyomi Araragi coming to realize the consequences of his choices.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nThis entry includes the second season of the Monogatari Series.",

What's worse, the principal's cruel and domineering daughter, Kanade Suzutsuki, has every reason to keep this secret from leaking out, and makes it her life's work to torment Kinjiro, while attempting to cure his gynophobia.\n\nIs Kanade simply sadistic or does she really want to help Kinjiro overcome his fears? It makes no difference to poor Kinjiro, because his life has just become a living hell.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

        "synopsis": "In this world, the concept of levels exist. Other than those who live off defeating monsters, most people are only around level 1 to 5. What's more, not just anyone can go out to hunt monsters; it's heavily influenced by one's role anointed by God. There are eight such eligible roles. Warrior. Fighter. Cleric. Magician. Rogue. Merchant. Hunter. Sorcerer. Those blessed with extraordinary power are divided into three types. Royalty. Heroes. Sages. But for the majority of the population, they have no such powers and live by farming or running shops. Towns are developed by those with the weakest role…villagers.\n\nFor the powerless villagers going out to hunt monsters is equivalent to committing suicide. But one day, a certain two-year-old child given the role of villager notices something.\n\nOnce you defeat a monster… you can earn great wealth.",

Ayaka Kagari, his classmate who sits next to him in class, on the other hand is the class \"Princess.\" Ayaka is tall, strikingly gorgeous and has a regalness to her that almost exudes a royal attitude. Despite their proximity in school, over the school year the two have never shared much conversation...until today. So today as class ended, Takamiya was suddenly attacked by a catered witch and her band of bunny-costumed thugs! And if that were not enough of a shock, this average joe would then be saved, like a princess by none other than Ayaka Kagari... a witch herself!\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",

        "synopsis": "Haruka, who spends his high school life as a loner, was suddenly summoned to another world one day along with all his classmates. When ol' God enters the picture, Haruka believes he can just choose whatever cheat skill he wants to help him survive in the new world... But, contrary to his expectations, that list of cheat skills works on a first come, first serve basis. And so, his classmates pick out all the cheat skills. His choices now limited to leftovers, Haruka finds himself incapable of assembling a party due to his own \"loner\" skill. Even though it's a different world, it seems his adventuring days will be, as per usual, a solitary affair...\n\nAfter becoming aware of a crisis looming over his classmates, Haruka makes a silent vow to save them. No relying on cheats! He will walk a heretical path of strength that transcends the need for them. The curtain rises on the strongest loner's otherworld strategy guide!\n\n(Source: Overlap, translated)",

        "synopsis": "A victim of endless bullying, Aito Eyama is plagued by his classmates' constant taunts and beatings. However, through a fortuitous turn of events, he receives a strange invitation to the Captivity Game, where victory promises unbelievable wealth. To participate, he must accept the role of captor and choose one victim to imprison for a month. For Eyama, the only choice is Aya Kirishima, the ringleader of his bullies and the source of all his suffering. The rules of the game are simple: the jailer may do whatever they please with their inmate, barring murder; but in order to win the game, the captor's identity must remain hidden. Exemption from the law, an isolated cell, and the funds to purchase supplies—all the necessary tools are provided.\n\nAs Eyama administers his sadistic revenge and \"divine\" retribution, he encounters other captors, each with their own hidden agendas. Meanwhile, Aya refuses to be a compliant prisoner and will go to any length to escape captivity. However, her endeavors threaten to awaken a darkness buried inside Eyama that craves to be unleashed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "From time immemorial to the age of space colonization, there is one legend that has stayed unchanged in every history book—the tale of the immortal bird Phoenix. A being whose blood is said to grant eternal life or wisdom, the radiant figure ensures the continuation of sentient life in the universe as it oversees human civilizations and their development.\n\nYet, mankind remains a slave to its habits; from happiness and sorrow, to wrath and love, a myriad of emotions continue to play an integral part of human life. Simultaneously, time and time again, certain beliefs and agendas persist over the centuries to disturb the fragile equilibrium of the world's preordained nature and principles. It appears that fate, with its dynamic variables, can manifest itself in many ways—and oftentimes exhibits a bizarre sense of humor.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: This is an incomplete series due to Tezuka's death.",
        "background": "Hi no Tori was published over the course of 21 years from 1967 to 1988, but was left incomplete due to Tezuka's death in 1989. The first seven chapters were serialized by COM magazine between 1967 to 1971; the remaining chapters were published by Manga Shounen and Yasei Jidai. Hi no Tori was published in English as Phoenix in 11 volumes by VIZ Media under the VIZ Signature imprint from March 12, 2003, to September 18, 2007. Previous to this, it had had a brief run in the educational publication Mangajin, from May to July, 1992 (issues #17 - #19).

Feared and friendless, he is also the reason that both he and female classmate Akira \"Aki\" Fujieda have their faces planted on the cold, hard floor on the day of their graduation.\n\nThe pair later awaken from the painful experience in their bedrooms. However, instead of graduation, they find themselves at their entrance ceremony, three years in the past. With no apparent way to return to the present, Imamura resolves to relive the high school life he missed out on, starting by joining the cheering club. But turning over a new leaf in the face of the difficult and boisterous club president Yoshiko Usami is easier said than done.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Serving as the ferrymen are the famous Kumou brothers: the eccentric family head, Tenka; the reckless but noble second son, Soramaru; and the guileless youngest, Chuutarou. In spite of their grim work, the three lead relatively peaceful lives in the ever-cloudy town of Oumi, together with their housekeeper, Shirasu Kinjou.\n\nBut buried in the long history of Oumi is the legend of the terrifying Orochi, a serpentine beast that awakens every three hundred years in a human vessel. Unbeknownst to Soramaru and Chuutarou, the actual job of the Kumou family is to seal the Orochi away before it fully revives—or the world will be plunged into destruction. Amid the monster's next resurrection, the Kumou family must find the resolve to keep laughing under the clouds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Utakata ni Warau (2 parts)",

        "synopsis": "Birth of a Hero is an ordinary novel where the kind protagonist, Choi Han, loses everyone he loves and falls deep into desperation. In order to get revenge, he leaves his home and heads to a nearby city where he beats up a low-life, drunken noble who was getting on his nerves, a barely relevant moment for this soon-to-be hero's journey.\n\nUnfortunately for Kim Roksu, he wakes up as Cale Henituse—the same drunkard noble who is destined to be beaten by Choi Han. However, Roksu has no intentions of letting the story keep its course and intends to live a peaceful life instead.  Using his knowledge of the novel from his previous life and the wealth from his current one, he plans to protect himself with the help of ancient spells in case he encounters the main lead.\n\nCale's wish to be free of worries for the rest of his days sounds easy on paper, but his actions might take him and the story in a completely different direction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She often uses it as an excuse to avoid doing things she dislikes, such as participating in her physical education class or getting along with her classmates. Out of concern and good will, her teacher assigns her to find the meaning of \"happiness.\"\n\nWhile Nanoka thinks about her homework, she often meets Abazure-san, a cheerful lady who helps her save a cat. Nanoka also pays regular visits to Obaa-chan, an old woman spending her twilight years in the woods. One day, Nanoka gets lost in the forest and stumbles across a high school girl named Minami committing self harm. As Nanoka gets closer to these three unique individuals, their stories and experiences shape for her a pathway toward soul-searching and self-discovery.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Instead of being a romantic moment, she receives an unexpected response from the boy, which progresses into a heated debate between the two.\n\nFrom that point forward, Nozomi and Shirou continue to meet at the train station and often end up arguing about their opinions on romance or the opposite gender. There is tension in their relationship, but as they carry on with these trivial yet precious conversations, the distance between the two awkward teenagers gradually closes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Miracle☆Gift",

        "synopsis": "Under the guidance of ruthless warrior King Andragoras III, the kingdom of Pars prospers, while the naive and gentle prince Arslan trains to continue his father's legacy. Arslan believes Pars to be a joyous and righteous land, until a captured slave his age from the hostile nation Lusitania escapes and takes him hostage, revealing to Arslan the horrors and cruelty slaves are subject to. Arslan is rescued, but the encounter leaves an impression on him.\n\nThree years pass, and Arslan's first battle against the Lusitanian army has come. Through the Lusitanian use of spies and traps, the battle ends in disaster, and the majority of Parsian troops are slain. With the aid of his loyal friend and bodyguard Daryun, the stricken prince barely manages to escape with his life. With his father nowhere to be found and his homeland now occupied by the enemy, Arslan loses everything in one fell swoop.\n\nSeeking shelter, Daryun takes the prince to his friend Narsus, an eccentric but brilliant strategist. With the help of Narsus and various other people he meets along the way, Arslan begins his campaign to reclaim his kingdom. The path is riddled with many challenges, from the greedy nobility to the mysterious warrior known as Silver Mask. Nonetheless, Arslan refuses to falter in his mission to save Pars from both its enemies and its own corruption.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With no way to distinguish them apart from humans, these entities recklessly slaughter people to fulfill their selfish desires.\n\nOrphan Park Hayan has always wanted a normal life: to keep her siblings safe from any potential danger and be able to find friends as a college student. But with the rise in vampire attacks, she fears that her life may crumble as traumatic memories return to haunt her.\n\nAfter a tragic accident makes her a target for the \"Angels of Death,\" an underground organization ruled by the most powerful vampires, Hayan decides to confront her past and partners up with Euntae Hwang, a member of the police force who is more than meets the eye. Her plan to eradicate every vampire begins here.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Next came the \"Dollies\"—terrifying doll-like giants with live \"human vacuums\" and an array of other ghastly weapons at their disposal.\n\nHalf a year later, only 1% of the global population remains, and traumatized survivor Iruma Ikaruga reflects on the carnage he witnessed on that tragic day. On the verge of suicide, he inadvertently saves a girl named Yuu Banira from her would-be rapists, and the grateful Banira invites him to join the resistance group Trial and Error.\n\nIruma reluctantly agrees, and he later witnesses Trial and Error's near-impossible feat of capturing a Dolly. However, the operation falls into shambles when a more powerful and intelligent \"Pygmy Doll\" appears, killing the captive and wreaking havoc at the location. But despite the slaughter, this encounter between Iruma and Pygmy will prove vital to unraveling the elusive mystery behind the Dollies' purpose and existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "\"Mine has been a life of much shame.\"\n\n\"I can't even guess myself what it must be to live the life of a human being.\"\n\nPlagued by a maddening anxiety, the terrible disconnect between his own concept of happiness and the joy of the rest of the world, Yozo Oba plays the clown in his dissolute life, holding up a mask for those around him as he spirals ever downward, locked arm-in-arm with death.\n\nOsamu Dazai's immortal—and supposedly autobiographical—work of Japanese literature, is perfectly adapted here into a manga by Junji Ito. The imagery wrenches open the text of the novel one line at a time to sublimate Yozo's mental landscape into something even more delicate and grotesque. This is the ultimate in art by Ito, proof that nothing can surpass the terror of the human psyche.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

        "synopsis": "At a business meeting, 26-year-old Tsugumi Kawana faces the biggest surprise in her life: she is reunited with Itsuki Ayukawa, a former high school friend and her first love. She is elated that Ayukawa has been able to achieve his dream of becoming an architect, while she herself has secured a stable job at an interior design company. As they reminisce about the past, Tsugumi is shocked to find out Ayukawa has been disabled following an accident. Unable to walk on his own, he now has to rely on the use of a wheelchair.\n\nTsugumi knows that dating a disabled person is a complex matter; moreso, she does not want to ruin her friendship with Ayukawa, who refuses to be romantically involved with anyone. However, as she begins to interact with him more and learns about his condition, Tsugumi realizes her feelings for him may not have disappeared entirely.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the school day ends, however, Hiroyuki becomes \"Zera,\" the enigmatic, beauty-obsessed emperor of the cult-like Hikari Club. For the past year, the Hikari Club has been creating an intelligent humanlike robot which runs on the lychee fruit, for the purpose of kidnapping beautiful girls.\n\nHowever, when the robot—named \"Litchi\"—finally brings back a girl, the Hikari Club begins to fall into disarray. As Zera becomes increasingly obsessed with executing those who betray him, the club's numbers begin to thin. As the remaining members begin to rebel and Litchi becomes increasingly human, will the Hikari Club ever be able to recover?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

And when they emerged from the darkness, the world that awaited them seemed like something out of a video game.\n\nIn order to survive, Haruhiro forms a party with the others, learns fighting skills, and as a soldier in the reserve force, takes his first steps into the world of Grimgar. What awaits him there, he doesn't know...\n\nThis is the story of an adventure born from the ashes.\n\n(Source: NanoDesu)",

Despite putting a lot of effort into the club, Usami soon realizes one thing—all of the other members are not taking the club seriously at all! The president, who has never been motivated to draw anything, spends his time snoozing on the clubroom couch. Collette Colletour, a mischievous and energetic girl, likes to play pranks on her fellow members. Subaru Uchimaki, a skilled artist capable of winning prizes, instead uses his talent to create the perfect 2D bride.\n\nUsami's middle school youth may not be as peaceful as she wishes, but there is never a dull moment during her time in the art club. And maybe—just maybe—they will find some time for art as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unlike the tranquil seaside town where they met, the city is a bustling metropolis, where people from all walks of life go about their lives. Even so, openly being in a homosexual relationship is never an easy task in a society that rejects those who go against the norm.\n\nTheir destination is Shun's family home, a place he left years ago after outing himself. Nearly everything is nostalgic about that place, from the very same dog to the very same roof, but a boisterous younger brother is an unexpected surprise. While Shun's mother wishes for the two to stay, his father remains emotionally disconnected from his son.\n\nAs they become reacquainted with family friends and grow accustomed to their new environment, Shun and Mio are faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge—coming to terms with their pasts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, Kippei's family introduces him to his five-year-old cousin, Yuzuru Sakashita, whose mother has abandoned her. Kippei is assigned the task of being Yuzuru's caregiver until her mother returns, and the young girl quickly grows attached to him.\n\nThrough Yuzuru's influence and the intimate bond that forms between them, Kippei learns not only about childcare, but also about developing meaningful relationships. As Kippei balances his time between Kokoro and Yuzuru, they all grow together and learn more about each other, their feelings, and the true meaning of family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to an incident surrounding his father leaving the family, Asuka was pressured into abandoning his hobbies in favor of kendo, judo, and karate. Resigning himself into living his life as someone who exudes manliness, he becomes the nationally ranked captain of his school's kendo team. Unfortunately, Asuka finds himself falling back on his old interests after crossing paths and falling in love with transfer student Ryo Miyakozuka.\n\nRyo is the exact opposite of Asuka. She has no interest in cooking, sewing, nor anything else that is \"girly\" in nature; however, she has a fierce kick and an equally tough attitude to match. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to collect material for a shoujo manga he is secretly publishing, Asuka's friend, Juta Tachibana, convinces Asuka to befriend the girl. As the relationship between the two begins to blossom, so does Asuka's true nature as an \"otomen.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 10: Glass no Otomen: Sen no Kamen wo Motsu Otomen\nVolume 11: Love-Tic",

Kaoru has been lying about his identity, and the two will soon meet in real life for the first time. When the day finally arrives, they realize that their expectations are quite different from reality.\n\nContrary to Kaoru's expectations, Nanami turns out to be a girl. With their genders revealed, they are both in shock—especially Nanami. She has already told her enthusiastic mother and overprotective father about her female friend coming to their house. Consequently, Nanami comes up with an idea to mask Kaoru's true gender: crossdressing! Even though their friendship started with lies, this odd meetup marks the beginning of their unusual bond.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At first, the manga was intended to follow the same story, but Sion Sono asked Usamaru Furuya to adapt his own story to it, which resulted in a plot much easier to understand.\n\nThe story begins with the same opening scene, where 54 girls commit suicide by jumping in front of a moving train. However, one girl survives (Saya Kota) and opens another Suicide Club, with other victims. Her best friend, Kyoko, fears for Saya's future and begins to search for the strange secrets surrounding the Suicide Club to try and save Saya and the other girls from committing such a tragedy again.",

Two thousand players are already dead.\n\nKirito and Asuna are two very different people, but they both desire to fight alone. Nonetheless, they find themselves drawn together to face challenges from both within and without. Given that the entire virtual world they now live in has been created as a deathtrap, the surviving players of Sword Art Online are starting to get desperate, and desperation makes them dangerous to loners like Kirito and Asuna. As it becomes clear that solitude equals suicide, will the two be able to overcome their differences to find the strength to believe in each other, and in so doing survive?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

A combination horror story and re-telling of the mythologies of the American South, Ore to Akuma no Blues (Me and the Devil Blues) features RJ, a man who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for the devil teaching him to play the blues. The story features many elements familiar to American readers but not much featured in Japanese comics, including the practice of lynching and the sharp racial divisions in the south around the time of the story.",

As the only male student, Hodaka Saotome enters the school to pursue a career in fashion, notably as he prepares to inherit his family's tailoring business. However, most of his schoolmates are unwelcoming, leading to him being targeted and harassed.\n\nOne day, Saotome's seemingly kind classmate Kasumi Takae invites him to the rooftop for lunch. Believing this may be his chance to finally make a friend, he instead falls into her trap, where she attempts to blackmail him. To everyone's surprise, the dire situation is interrupted when Hanako Kuzuryuu, an intimidating delinquent, steps in to save Saotome.\n\nAfter defending Saotome from Takae's plan, Hanako forms an unexpected friendship with him and tries her best to keep the boy safe from any mischief. With Hanako’s help, Saotome strives to avoid the other girls' antics and survive at the school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Humans call them \"calamities\"—the unknown, destructive creatures that suddenly appeared on earth. To challenge these calamities, the zodiac gods awakened 12 humans known as saints. But there was one more that awoke—unchosen but the greatest hero of all: Geon Lee. His allies betrayed him and left him for dead, but now, 20 years later, he's more powerful than ever and ready to teach his fellow \"saints\" a lesson they'll never forget.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",

They continue their lives with Utsutsu doing everything he can to take care of his little sister.\n\nHowever, their short-lived period of peace comes to an end when Yume suddenly transforms into a horrific abomination and goes on a rampage, killing people and consuming their flesh. It turns out that Yume has contracted a peculiar and obscure virus named \"Pupa.\" Although he is shocked at the sight of his sister's monstrous appearance, it seems that Utsutsu also carries this strange disease. He, however, is only partially affected, with the virus giving him regenerative powers beyond that of a normal human being. \n\nEven so, Utsutsu remains unyielding in his resolve to protect his sister, even if he has to sacrifice his own body for her sustenance. Nevertheless, all of their problems have only just begun, as they uncover the mysteries behind the horrors that afflict them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After meeting North Italy, Germany is stunned that the once powerful empire is now just a useless crybaby with a concerningly deep love for pasta. To make matters worse, his only other ally, Japan, is near-impossible to read and has equally strange interests. While Germany grapples with his eccentric partners, the Allies are knocking at their door, looking for a fight.\n\nUsing personified nations and humor, Hetalia Axis Powers recounts the events of World Wars I and II in a comedic light. Along the way, the relationship between nations and cultural anecdotes are explored in a quirky and fun manner.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her mother, Ye Feii, was Taiwan's top model, and her father was also a model, until a tragic airplane crash left Lele without parents.\n\nTherefore it is no surprise that Lele hates the industry, thinking it superficial and unnecessary. Raised by her paternal grandmother, Lele reaches seventeen before she is sucked in by her mother's sister, Ye Feihung, a fashion agent (and former model) who \"convinces\" the reluctant Lele to pose. Lele is averse to the whole idea, until she sees a photo shoot of popular American model Angus Lanson, and she begins to see modeling as an art form.\n\nWhen Aunt Feihung's magazine editor invites Angus Lanson to a meeting of all the top fashion ambassadors, Lele is invited along and is curious to meet Angus. She does not know that Angus' twin elder brother, Eros Lanson, is secretly accompanying his brother. This obviously leads to confusion and is the start of a charming story of Lele's goals: Fashion in New York city, becoming a top model, and love? \n\n(Source: ShoujoMagic)",

        "synopsis": "Tamiya Nika is a beautiful, outgoing, popular high school girl. She has just the right look, just the right fashions, and is everyone's friend. What everyone at school does not know is how hard Nika works to keep up this perfect image, and what she is REALLY like at home. When not at school, Nika is a scary, sloppy, tight-fisted girl who wears glasses, an ugly sweatsuit, and has her hair pulled back into unattractive buns. She lays around playing video games and reading manga. Her attitude is bossy and cranky, and she travels far out of her way to shop where she won't be recognized.\n\nEvery day, Nika \"Switches On\" with a strict regimen of beautification that involves primping and plucking and careful dressing. The only person who knows about Nika's Switched On/Off modes is her best friend, who is also aware of the reasons behind the changes.\n\nHowever, soon a second person finds about about Nika's personalities - someone who has his own On/Off switch, but in reverse! His name is Kamiyama Arata, and he is a recent transfer student. He meets Nika when she is in OFF Mode, and then again at school when she is ON. However Nika can see that he has his little secret. At school, Arata wears thick swirly-eyed glasses and messy hair that make some bullies think he is an otaku. However, at home, he ditches the glasses and is downright gorgeous! He is just the opposite of Nika, but why?\n\n(Source: MANGAtoshokan)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Switch Girl!! (pilot)",

Akashi realizes that he is in the wrong, and so he immediately returns to school. However, instead of open gates, he finds the school completely sealed off from the outside world. Soon after, a giant cat's head blasts through the windows, and Akashi spots Aoyama dressed in a rat costume while drenched in blood.\n\nOnly three students manage to leave school alive that day, and similar occurrences are reported throughout the world. Akashi is not free from harm, however, as he is invited to partake in a deadly game whose participants are composed of those who missed school on that fateful day.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Swearing vengeance on her killers, Aika's older brother, Mahiro, sets out to determine who ended her life prematurely. Unbeknownst to Mahiro, his childhood friend and Aika's secret longtime boyfriend, Yoshino Takigawa, ends up getting dragged into the investigation after being held at gunpoint by a strange woman. Yoshino learns that Mahiro is being investigated by the government after outbreaks of a mysterious \"iron sickness\" in two locations where he was previously seen. Now on the run, Mahiro and Yoshino's search for Aika's killers becomes harder and more dangerous.\n\nIn an effort to find a lead on his sister's murder, Mahiro strikes a deal with Hakaze Kusaribe, the most powerful sorceress in the world who is imprisoned on a deserted island. As princess and leader of the Kusaribe Clan, Hakaze promises to aid Mahiro's investigation if he can rescue her from internment. Once free, Hakaze intends to put a stop to the revival of the \"Tree of Exodus\" and save the world from eventual ruin. Believing that Hakaze will get in the way of his resurrection plans, Samon Kusaribe, Hakaze's former aide, had orchestrated her banishment and removed her ability to use magic on the island.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to save the world from the effects of the \"Trees of Exodus and Genesis,\" Mahiro and Yoshino inch closer to the truth behind Aika's death. The two find that there might be more to her murder than they initially thought as the world around them falls into chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Kou Kitamura is a fifth grader whose family runs a sporting goods store. One of the regular customers of his family's store is the Tsukishima Batting Center, and so he gets to know the four daughters of the Tsukishima family (Ichiyo, Wakaba, Aoba, and Momiji) very well. Since Kou has spent so much time practicing in their batting cages, he has become a genius hitter, but has no knowledge of any other aspect of baseball. This is in contrast to Aoba, who, despite being a year younger, is an adept pitcher and hitter. Wakaba is a classmate of Kou's, and she seems fully intent on marrying him when she grows up. All seems idyllic in their world, until tragedy strikes. The story then skips ahead to four years later, as Kou has continued the training he began four years ago, but has not played in a baseball game since. As he finally begins playing again, it remains to be seen whether or not he will live up to the expectations of those who know the true talent he has been hiding all this time.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

He decides to accept his situation and sit back when he learns that the train is headed toward his hometown in Kurayoshi.\n\nAs he walks the streets of his childhood neighborhood, Hiroshi realizes how significantly the place has changed in the 20 years since his mother died. While visiting her grave in the Genzen Temple, he is transported back into the body of his 14-year-old self. Retaining the memories and wisdom of his middle-aged mind, he is now an eighth grader in junior high school.\n\nHiroshi's regained youth enables him to escape the reality of being an adult man with a wife and two daughters. Unaware how to return to his original time, he begins to relive his adolescence.
