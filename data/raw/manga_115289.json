    "synopsis": "When they were little kids, Yuujirou Matsukaze rescued the poor Rui Hanamine from an unlucky incident. It was love at first sight for Yuujirou, and from that moment on, he knew that he had to protect Rui at all costs.\n\nNow in high school, Rui stands tall at 186 centimeters and is strongly attached to Yuujirou, who is conscious of his height of only 165 centimeters. Despite knowing each other for so long, Rui remains oblivious to Yuujirou's feelings, and Yuujirou cannot bring himself to express his emotions. But as they grow more aware of what they feel deep inside, the harder it gets to contain their sweet sentiments for each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
