    "synopsis": "Kohinata Asanaro is your regular everyday high school student. He likes light novels, porn games, and fantasizing about the girls in his class. One day when walking home from school he inexplicably releases a demon from a sealed bottle. Her name is Zepafur, and she won't rest until her debt is repaid!\n\n\"Now begins the Lovey Dovey Harem Royale!\" cries the demon, weaving a most curious magic. As a result, Asanaro's regular high school life transforms into a love-comedy series of harem shenanigans, with four girls from his school all vying for his affection!\n\nBut...unbeknownst to our dopey protagonist, the four girls are in the midst of a horrific survival game under threat of death and eternal torture. She who fails to capture Asanaro's heart will be confined to the depths of hell.\n\nJust who will survive? Who will thrive? And who will meet their demise?\n\n(Source: Sol Press)",
