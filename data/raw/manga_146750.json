    "synopsis": "A man with no memories awakens on the shore of a desolate island with only a washed-up mailbox next to him. Soon enough, he stumbles upon an odd bed and breakfast, run by an even stranger family. The mother's kind smile quickly turns uncanny, the overly devout father relishes brutal hunts, and their three children are unnervingly unpredictable. The family makes no effort to conceal their home's sinister air as they taunt him and make him question his sanity.\n\nFearing for his life, the man steels himself to survive. As the family's hair-raising secrets slowly pile up, he grasps at his forgotten memories, haunted by dreams of unnaturally large pigs and a child that does not exist. The island's horrors close in, and the man is left with a desperate goal to uncover the truth behind his arrival and escape this cursed place before he loses his mind—or his life—to the creeping dread.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
