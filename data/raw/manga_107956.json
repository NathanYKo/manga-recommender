    "synopsis": "Young college student Nonohiko is faced with a dilemma: his super-cheap college dorm has been closed down! But, he finally finds an all-male share house. The beautiful landlady (actually a cross-dressing guy) only approves hot men as residents, but Nonohiko somehow manages to meet this strange requirement. Moving day brings a mix of fear and anticipation. A man in fashionable glasses, who lives in the share house, invites Nonohiko into the bath, only to mistake him for someone who provides \"special services\"...! An innocent rom-com that springs from the personality gap between a flirty, bespectacled CEO and a pure-hearted college student!\n\n(Source: Renta!)",
