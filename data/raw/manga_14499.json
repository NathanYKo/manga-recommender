    "synopsis": "Known only as \"The Game,\" it takes players on a thrilling ride, bringing heart-pounding excitement and a sense of loftiness, and possibly a nice wad of cash. The rules are simple: seduce salary men into vulnerable positions before taking off with their money and dignity. Together with an aggressive and competitive group of high school dropouts, 16-year-old Kizuna Etou plays The Game, but begins to have second thoughts. Unfortunately, leaving isn't an option; the final rule of The Game states that no one is allowed to quit. Ever.\n\nHowever, after one of her night-time escapades, Kizuna is approached by a persistent woman with a captivating job offer: model in the nude for the taciturn painter Yusei Asai. Though at first dismissive of each other, these individuals slowly begin to change their stubborn habits and open their hearts to one another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
