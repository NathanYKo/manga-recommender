    "synopsis": "Their city is filled with criminals and three incredible high schoolers. Yuugo, Rikiya and Tasuku are determined to clean up the city with whatever means necessary, even if that means using violence. During a typical night of wiping out gangs, Tasuku comes across a beautiful girl held prisoner. She helps him survive what would have been a mortal wound by allowing him to see the future. Tasuku rescues her and takes her home where he finds that her name is Noa, but she doesn’t speak at all and lost her memory. Even more fascinating to Tasuku, she bears the same tattoo as the person he has been searching for years. This sparks the beginning of as chain of events leading to Tasuku's and the other character's dark and mysterious pasts.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers; edited)",
