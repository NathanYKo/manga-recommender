    "synopsis": "A death game where players are forced to kill one another until there's only one person left standing!\n\nThis is the story of Ryosuke Miyauchi, a young man who survived a real-life battle royale game three years ago, and who has been struggling to live a normal life since then. One day, Ryosuke was scouted by the enormously popular game developer EDC, who asked him, \"Why don't you use your special experience to make a game?\"\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
