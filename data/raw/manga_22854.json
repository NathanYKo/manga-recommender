    "synopsis": "Yamada Masami leads a double life. During the day, she's an ordinary student in Tokyo with glasses and pigtail braids. At night, she dresses herself up and becomes the glamorous call girl Miyabi. She doesn't just do it for the money; she loves the pleasure and happiness she can bring to her customers.\n\nIt seems like this double life can't last forever, though. Her chubby friend Aki, who spends her time desperately dieting in order to attract a man, doesn't understand why Masami is so opposed to getting a boyfriend. Her other classmates, the perverted Kaneko and the rich Sasaki Kaori, have opposing views of the acceptability of the pleasure industries. What will happen if the people who know Masami during the day discover the secret existence of the lovely Miyabi?\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 10: Delivery Cinderella (pilot)",
