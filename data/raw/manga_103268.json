    "synopsis": "​Before the creation of Disboard, a world where everything is decided by games, there raged a terrible war among the various races. The Immanity weren't the only ones fighting to end that war, though—one Elf had her own plans: Whoever's left standing after the world is destroyed is the winner! What tricks did Think Nirvalen have up her sleeve all those years ago? Who was actually pulling the strings behind the Great War? And did Nina Clive, Think's overworked assistant, even make it out alive?!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
