    "synopsis": "\"Our grade's top scorer, an unapproachable guy, only opens up to me. That's so friggin' adorable!\"\n\nSaegusa is utterly bored of his high school life. Along comes Arochi Tooru, a guy with the brightest hair he’s ever seen, who transfers into his class. It's an oddity already, for some guy with outrageous looks and a cold attitude, to transfer into a prep school. So he immediately draws the attention of everyone in his class. What's more, he's apparently a genius who cinches the top spot in their grade on their class exam.\n\nOne day, Saegusa uses a common point of interest to approach Arochi, and the two start to become closer. But once they become friends, Arochi is actually really oblivious and cute! Saegusa just can't take his eyes off this cutie!\n\n(Source: Sankosha, translated)",
