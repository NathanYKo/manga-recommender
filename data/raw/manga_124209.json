    "synopsis": "Kaoru Terazaki is a young boy who uses a female character in an online game. He usually plays with a virtual friend who goes by the username Nanami and uses a male avatar. Kaoru has been lying about his identity, and the two will soon meet in real life for the first time. When the day finally arrives, they realize that their expectations are quite different from reality.\n\nContrary to Kaoru's expectations, Nanami turns out to be a girl. With their genders revealed, they are both in shock—especially Nanami. She has already told her enthusiastic mother and overprotective father about her female friend coming to their house. Consequently, Nanami comes up with an idea to mask Kaoru's true gender: crossdressing! Even though their friendship started with lies, this odd meetup marks the beginning of their unusual bond.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
