    "synopsis": "For millions of years, humanity remained blissfully unaware that the common pests known as mosquitoes were secretly preparing for a murderous plan. Collecting information through harvesting DNA, the bloodsuckers slowly amassed power—until they suddenly transformed into humanoid forms one day. With the mosquitoes now immune to conventional weaponry and possessing all of mankind's knowledge, it wasn't long before they decimated the human population.\n\nA full century since, mankind is all but extinct: a mere five thousand humans remain, while the evolved mosquitoes number over a trillion. However, a faint spark of hope persists in the lost research of Dr. Kim, a scientist who predicted the insects' mutation. Having pinpointed his bunker deep within mosquito territory, the surviving forces of humanity scramble to secure what may be their last chance to turn the tides. Headed by elite soldier Kisses and her squad, mankind launches their final assault, sparking the decisive confrontation in the war between man and mosquito.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
