    "background": "The one-shot Nejishiki is considered Tsuge's most famous work and has become a key example of avant-garde manga. It was first published in English as The Stopcock in the scholarly journal Concerned Theatre Japan, 1971 (Vol. 2 #2). The one-shot was again published in English as Screw-Style in the American magazine The Comics Journal, February 2003 (No. 250). It was adapted into a PC-9800 game in 1989. Ooba Denki Mekki Kougyou-sho was published in English as Oba's Electroplate Factory in the avant-garde alternative comics magazine RAW, May 15, 1990 (No. 2). Drawn and Quarterly released the entire collection in English on October 3, 2023. Japanese film director Teruo Ishii adapted Gensenkan Shujin and Nejishiki into live-action films, which were released in 1993 and 1998, respectively.",
