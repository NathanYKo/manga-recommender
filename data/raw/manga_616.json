    "synopsis": "Taiga Kuzumi is a resolute student who hopes to enroll into the elite Seinagi Private High School. But for some reason, the school rejects him, despite believing he aced the written test. Also strange is that he is unable to recall the events of his interview. Nonetheless, Taiga does remember one thing: the laughter of a cute and attractive girl who was present at the time.\n\nEager to meet her again, Taiga wanders up to Seinagi's school gates in hopes of seeing her. Instead, he is met with the peculiar sight of a teacher hovering above the ground! As it turns out, Seinagi Private High School is actually a secret magic school, where its students are taught the arts of spellworking. \n\nIn order to conceal this fact, the school decides Taiga must join them as a first-year student. However, such comes with its own problems, as Taiga is the only one who cannot use magic in a school that otherwise brims with talented young magicians! \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
