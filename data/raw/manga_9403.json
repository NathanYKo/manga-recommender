    "synopsis": "Love Letter\nIt is World War II. Deemed as the enemy of the entire world, Japan has become the hapless victim of frequent bombings and aerial attacks. In this era of endless strife and widespread uncertainty for the future, love blossoms between two young individuals, Chieko Mochida and Toshio Anazawa.\n\nDespite their mutual feelings, the ongoing crisis and their own difficult backgrounds constantly keep the couple separated. After Toshio joins the military to protect the country, the distance between the two increases even further. Nevertheless, Chieko and Toshio wholeheartedly persist with their relationship through love letters—all while having to face the brutal consequences of war.\n\nHalf &amp; Half\nOn the way to his art school in Tokyo, ambitious Shinichi Nagakawa gets involved in a road accident alongside an unfamiliar girl. When the two regain consciousness, seemingly alone in a bizarre blank space, a mysterious voice suddenly reveals that they are dead. However, there is a way for one of them to be revived: the other one has to sacrifice themselves.\n\nTaken aback by the situation, the duo is given seven days to make their decision—a period of time where they will also be sharing their emotions and sensations. While initially reluctant, the girl eventually opens up to Shinichi and introduces herself as Yuuki Sanada. As the final day approaches, Shinichi and Yuuki grow more intimate, gradually discovering their lingering regrets and genuine affections for each other.\n\nAzusa\nHaving had feelings for his senior, Hazuki Itou, since the beginning of high school, Kenji Kuroda finally gathers up the courage to give her a love letter. However, the letter is accidentally sent to another girl named Azusa Itou, who happily accepts Kenji's confession. Swayed by Azusa's cheerful and ingenuous nature, Kenji hesitantly begins to go out with her.\n\nAs Kenji's heart continues to waver because of Azusa, what will become of the two's relationship that started merely from a mistake?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
