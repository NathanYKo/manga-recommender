    "synopsis": "Saburou discovered his passion for cooking after an injury prevented him from continuing to play baseball. One day while going out to get ingredients, he finds himself in another world covered in vast plains, and is taken in by a tribe of nomadic elves. However, the food they make tastes so bad that it's barely edible! With his cooking skills, Saburou starts making meals for the elves, showing them how delicious food can really be.\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
