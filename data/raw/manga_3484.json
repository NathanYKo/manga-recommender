    "synopsis": "Although her life isn't exactly like a shoujo manga, Miku Ikenouchi's friends are convinced that it's pretty close. They say Miku is \"doing well in the spring of her life\"... Miku, on the other hand, is a bit skeptical. Sure, she has recently started dating a third year, has a decent part-time job, and her home life is peaceful. In fact, you could even say that Miku is content... but, maybe, too content?\n\nUnfortunately, when she comes home Miku no longer has time to find out that her father has quit his job, and her parents are turning their home into a... boarding house?  And, even worse, one of the new boarders is a guy from her school?! Miku is quickly going to find her peaceful days a distant memory from the past...",
