    "synopsis": "When Aida Minami was little, she fell in love with the long-distance runner Manabe Keiichi. He was in the club that her school teacher mother supervised. But all her hopes were dashed when Manabe confessed to her that he was in love with her mother! Worse yet, he promised to take care of both her and her mother! Talk about an instant love defeat! But it seems that the worst is not over yet because after a few years, Minami finds out that Manabe is now a teacher at her high school and the supervisor of the track and field club in which she belongs! Will her heart have a chance this time?\n\n(Source: Aerandria)",
