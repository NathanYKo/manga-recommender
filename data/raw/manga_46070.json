Shiho dreams of teaching piano in her small town in the future. One day, a transfer student arrives from Tokyo. The transfer student, Koba Nanami, is beautiful, but quietly contemptuous of the isolated country town.\n\nSoon, Shiho learns that Nanami is much more skilled at the piano than she is. What's worse, Nanami has no interest in piano, and mostly quit playing years ago. Will Shiho be able to continue enjoying the piano and strive for her dream, knowing that she doesn't measure up to even indifferent players her age? On top of her musical dream, Shiho is moving into the awkward teenage stage of life, full of small humiliations, friendship, and tentative romance.\n\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
