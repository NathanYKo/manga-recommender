    "synopsis": "Rina Suzuki claims she has zero interest in love. While most girls are ogling the popular male clique led by the laidback Hibiki Takumi, Rina is proud to say she does not need a man. She does not need to be spoiled, she is not lonely, and being in love is nothing worth bragging about.\n\nAs someone who has never experienced love, Rina cannot understand what is so great about it. But this mindset takes a drastic turn when she gets a new neighbor—Takumi himself. Unlike her, romance is just another part of his daily life; he has always been fawned over by girls. After Takumi requests Rina's aid in warding off a stalker, he kisses her, throwing her world into chaos. Rina realizes she has been envious of others and has actually been longing for the bliss that comes from romance. For the first time, she sets out to experience the feeling of loving another and being loved in return.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji Bangai-hen",
