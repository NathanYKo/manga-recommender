    "synopsis": "Former famous child actor Keito Aoyama's acting career was cut short due to her poor performance in a musical in front of a big audience. Now a reclusive 16-year-old girl refusing to attend high school, she finds her daily life meaningless.\n\nHowever, one day, Keito comes across an unusual high school named El Liston, where any student can enroll in for whatever reason. Taking this as a new opportunity to overcome her past, she decides to enter. There, she meets and befriends a group of students, each with their own talents: Kouichi Mine, a genius programmer always absorbed in technology; Rei Saeki, a formerly famous soccer player; and Momiji Noda, who aspires to become a fashion designer.\n\nAs Keito gets closer to her new friends, her life starts becoming vibrant again. Her experience at El Liston fills her with bliss and a longing for the limelight once more. Along the way, her interest in romance starts to develop as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
