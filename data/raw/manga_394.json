    "synopsis": "It is said that all that glitters—even the stars—can be stolen away in the blink of an eye by the King of Bandits. Heeded by all, this warning has spread around the world, yet nobody knows who the elusive thief truly is.\n\nJing, an inconspicuous vagabond, and Kir, his winged friend with a foul mouth, are not only on the hunt for rare gems and ancient relics, but also anything that catches the eye and pleases the heart. At first glance, most may overlook the filthy boy in his ragged coat with the bird on his shoulder. But when their cherished possessions are taken away, Jing will also steal their attention, opening their eyes to the true intent of the figure they once blindly thought to fear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
