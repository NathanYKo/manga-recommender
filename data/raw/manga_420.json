    "synopsis": "Yaya Higuchi is a fan of visual kei musicians and gothic lolita fashion. As a child, her dream was to grow up and become a great singer. However, she now hides her passion six days a week, afraid that she will be ridiculed by her peers or her overly strict father. Only on Sundays can she freely express herself among like-minded teens in Harajuku.\n\nEven without disclosing her secret hobbies, Yaya is treated poorly by Seri and Moe, two mean girls who she calls friends. As hard as she tries to remain optimistic, Yaya is painfully aware that no one at school speaks to her besides her bullies and an almost offensively straightforward male classmate named Moriyama.\n\nWhen a fierce, no-nonsense girl named Nana starts taking care of Yaya's troubles—paying back Seri and Moe for their cruel pranks and kicking down predatory men who approach Yaya in the street—it seems too good to be true. Moriyama encounters Nana more than once, and as he sees Yaya in class every day, he gradually begins to suspect that these two vastly different girls are the same person!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
