    "synopsis": "Three years ago, an abrupt ceasefire ended a long and devastating conflict between the Republic of Frost and the Empire, bringing about peace and sending both nations on the arduous journey of recovery. In the battle-scarred Empire, sickness and starvation ravage the lands, and many former soldiers turn to crime, adding to a common man's misery. To combat this, the Empire has established Imperial Army State Section III, known as Pumpkin Scissors—a platoon dedicated to war relief and reconstruction.\n\nAlthough the young and energetic Second Lieutenant Alice L. Malvin honorably leads Pumpkin Scissors, the unit is seen as nothing more than a shameless propaganda tool used only to placate the masses. As Alice strives to further her unit's cause and win the favor of the populace, she decides to recruit Randal Oland, a mysterious and kind veteran with a grim past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
