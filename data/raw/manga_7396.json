    "synopsis": "It's the 21st century already, and yet, there's still someone referred to as a \"Prince\"!?\n\nBorn to a small European country, his mother is of royalty there. His father on the other hand, heir to prosperous European shipping industry, is a descendant of Queen Victoria.\n\nSince birth, Elian has been groomed to be the crown prince, filled with natural confidence…(Then again, he could have been born this way). To put it bluntly, he's an arrogant person.\n\nDania, on the other hand, is a girl whose father has left her for another woman, and she has to work for a living. However, her sister gets married to Elian's father, and she attends the wedding in Greece. There she meets him for the first time...\n\n(Source: MU)",
