    "synopsis": "The Assistant Mage of the genius alchemist Ruby—Lloyd has an abnormally low chance of gathering materials for alchemy use. Hence, he is treated as baggage and is made to be the bottom of the entire country's joke. Everyday is a day he is scolded by Ruby. It's become too much of a despairing environment that he's come to hate it. And so, he finally decided to part ways with her. However, unbeknownst to everyone was that the materials Lloyd gathered were all high-grade materials no one else could gather. The mage, who was treated as \"incompetent\" and saw himself as such, now aims for an ideal easy going life!\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
