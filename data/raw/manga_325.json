    "synopsis": "Yukinari Sasaki is an average high school boy who has female-phobia...and an allergic reaction when girls touch him. One day, he falls through his tub to a bath to an alien planet called \"Siren\" where the population is 90% female. There he meets the sweet Miharu, whom he can touch without breaking into a rash! When the pair returns to earth, they're joined by a wacky collection of friends and enemies who make every day one of laughter, life lessons, and fan service!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
