    "synopsis": "Kiritani Konome is the dream girl for any young boy: she is smart, considerate, and remarkably beautiful. Falling head over heels for Kiritani is her junior and fellow kendo club member Tamao Tsukamu, a meek yet perverted high school student. Unfortunately for him, Kiritani is already engaged to the student council president—the extraordinary Sasugaki Kunitake—which discourages Tamao from confessing his love.\n\nTo his surprise, Kiritani invites Tamao to the student council room, where Sasugaki presents him with a bizarre proposition. Tamao must contribute to the graduation album's special section, composed of erotic pictures of the school's female students. Tasked with this unusual job, Tamao begins to collect pictures of all the girls and engages in numerous sexual relationships. However, Sasugaki seems to be hiding a dark secret behind this strange tradition, which Tamao and Kiritani will have to uncover together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: JC Ecchi Senden Manga: Seiousai Zenjitsu (The Day Before the Saint Cherry Blossom Festival), Camii Dock!",
