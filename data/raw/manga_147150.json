    "synopsis": "Do Yohan does not remember much about his past, but he does know that Lee Dajeong is the most important person in his life. She is the center of his world; he knows what she is doing at any moment in time, and her face captured from every angle is plastered throughout his bedroom. He does not consider himself a stalker and believes his intentions are pure. After all, he just wants to protect her.\n\nUnable to approach Dajeong, Yohan watches over her from afar, always one step away in case she needs help. And she truly needs it; someone else seems to also have their gaze affixed on her, and their intentions are far less kind. Could this person and Dajeong be the keys to unlocking Yohan's past?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
