A petite boy with a loud voice, Himi is terrified of darkness because of a tremor he suffered when he was a kid. On the other hand, Furuya is afraid of bright lights and gets real nervous when he’s feeling uneasy. How would they help each other to overcome the fears?\n\n(Source: Attractive Fascinante)",
