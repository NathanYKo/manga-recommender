    "synopsis": "Kouji Aiba has been living a school life unrelated to girls until a strange phenomenon called “loss time” occurs, where time stops for only one hour per day. In such a still world, Kouji wants to regain his youth after meeting a young girl named Tokine Shinomiya, who has a scarlet eye that can move during loss time when she is stopped. In a world where only two people move, the distance gradually decreases, and eventually, Kouji's feelings for Tokine change to first love. But Tokine seems to have a big secret that obstructs her thoughts.\n\n(Source: MU)",
