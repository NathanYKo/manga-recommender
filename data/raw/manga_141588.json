    "synopsis": "The start of a happy life together with a high school girl who has fallen into the bottom of despair.\n\nOne day, Yuusuke Yuuki, who spent his high school life only in studying and working part-time in order to maintain his scholarship, found himself strongly wishing for a girlfriend. On the way home, feeling lonely from such thought, he casually looked up into the sky and saw a girl who was about to throw herself off the rooftop of an abandoned building.\n\n\"Why the hell are doing something like this!\" \"Because I...don't have any...reason to live...\" \"Wait. It'd be a shame for a beauty to die\" \"....?\" \"Rather than dying, be my girlfriend\" \"Eeh?\"\n\nThus, a new love story and daily life with a mysterious girl, Kotori Hatsushiro, which all started from a strange encounter, begins.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
