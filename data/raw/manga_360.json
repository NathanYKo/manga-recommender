He and his android partner, Heat Guy J, team up to make sure that anything illegal stays off the streets and out of circulation.\n\nHowever, their presence doesn't sit too well with the local mob leader—a ruthless, unbalanced, well-armed son of the late Don, who is out to prove that he is not too young to take over the family business. In the city that never sleeps, will Daisuke and Heat Guy J end up sleeping with the fishes?\n\n(Source: TokyoPop)",
