    "synopsis": "Kagome Higurashi's ordinary life comes to an abrupt halt when a demon drags her deep into a well, transporting her five hundred years into the past. In this era, Kagome quickly learns two things: demons walk amongst humans and she has unknowingly brought a dangerous object from her world—a marble-sized sphere known as the Shikon Jewel. This unusual orb brings tremendous power to any demon who has it in their possession, and Kagome is an easy target for anyone determined enough to steal it.\n\nWhile in a fight with a demon, a hasty attempt to fend it off causes Kagome to accidentally shatter the jewel, sending countless pieces of it all over feudal Japan. She soon learns the grave consequences of her actions when she must work with the half-demon Inuyasha to collect all the pieces of the jewel before they fall into the wrong hands.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "InuYasha won the 47th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category in 2001. The series was published in English by VIZ Media as Inu-Yasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale from July 6, 1998, to January 11, 2011. In this version, the manga was relabeled as InuYasha from volume 12 onwards, and the first 37 volumes were in left-to-right format but all later volumes were printed in traditional Japanese format. It was republished in 3-in-1 omnibuses under the Shonen Sunday VIZBIG imprint from November 10, 2009, to February 11, 2014. It was also released in Spain by Glénat España; and in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora JBC in 112 volumes from August 2002 to July 2009. The first 12 volumes were released in Argentina by LARP Editores before discontinuing publication.
