    "synopsis": "Aiming to become a sensei like his former sensei, Sugiura Sakae came to an elementary school as a contract teacher. Coincidently, his former sensei, Fukada Ryuuji, is currently teaching here. Ryuu sensei is Sakae’s idol as well as his pillar of support. However, the “Ryuu sensei” he once so admired, is totally different now. Feeling bothered, Sakae slowly realizes that his feelings for sensei have become love. But what about Ryuu sensei?\n\n(Source: Attractive Fascinante)",
