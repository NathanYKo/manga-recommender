    "synopsis": "University student Nam Dong-Gyun never misses out on the nightly livestream of his favorite broadcasting jockey, Alex. To fulfill his viewers' neverending fantasies, BJ Alex—who wears a mask to conceal his face—performs sensually arousing acts. Most of the time, Dong-Gyun ends up indulging in sexual pleasure after watching the steamy show. Being in blissful ignorance, he has fallen in love with the gay cam boy.\n\nAt school, Dong-Gyun meets Ahn Jiwon, the amiable and radiant president of the student council. When he invites Dong-Gyun to a drinking party, it quickly ends in total failure as Dong-Gyun becomes extremely intoxicated. In the company of Jiwon, he arrives safely in his apartment.\n\nWhile his colleague cleans himself from the bumpy ride, Dong-Gyun fixes his eyes on Jiwon's half-naked body; his physique resembles that of BJ Alex's! Unable to contain his excitement, Dong-Gyun asks if he and BJ Alex are the same person—the response he gets is unexpected. With a different side of Jiwon exposed, Dong-Gyun will never be able to look at him the same way ever again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
