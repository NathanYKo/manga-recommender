    "synopsis": "These people have been living unhappy lives because they've never been able to do what they want.\n\nGa Yeon's smart, but wants to become a singer. However, the Korean educational system strongly enforces studying to students without considering the goals and dreams of the student. She's been forced to live a life of suppression.\n\nJae Hee is a piano player, but he's been living in constant delusion of his life. He has mental problems and cannot distinguish reality from a dream.\n\nDong Woo and Min Seo are a couple who are talented musicians but cannot make music they wish to make because of the current situation of the Korean music industry.\n\nHyuk's a very good guitar player, but is forced to be in an idol band, rather than what he really wants to be. \n\nThe 5 come together to make a band of their own.\n\n(Source: MU)\n\n\nNote: originally a webcomic later published by Random House Korea.",
