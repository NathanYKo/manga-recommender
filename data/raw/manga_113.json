    "synopsis": "Retiring as a soldier of the government of a high-tech city, Fay Ryu Kazuhiko's transition into civilian life is cut short when his superior, General Ko, summons him. Having a leaf imprinted onto his hand by code, Kazuhiko is entrusted with a secret task to deliver a \"package\"—a girl with white hair and evergreen eyes whom he finds singing in a birdcage-like building. All Kazuhiko knows is that her name is Suu, and for whatever reason, she wishes to go to Fairy Park.\n\nAs his friends Lan and Gingetsu help set up a transport module for the duo, Kazuhiko suspects that there is more to Suu than he knows. Not only is their transport intercepted, but the two are also pursued by Bols—a face that is uncomfortably familiar to Kazuhiko and who seems to have received his own mission to seek out Suu. The truth behind the discreet nature of this operation, Suu's existence, and even a possible connection between her and Kazuhiko may all be linked to just one word: clover.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
