The year is now 2020, and Tokyo is hosting the Summer Olympics with Mina as guest of honor at the opening ceremonies. During her speech, terrorists infiltrate the stadium and demand that she close the Bund and remove all vampires from Japan. In front of TV cameras, Mina and her loyal werewolf bodyguard Akira must confront the terrorists, while ensuring the safety of human bystanders.\n\nAs the events of the past come back to haunt her, new threats emerge that will stop at nothing to thwart Mina at every turn in the quest to destroy all of vampirekind.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas)",
