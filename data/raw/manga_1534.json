    "synopsis": "On the surface, Jin Kanzaki may seem like an ordinary street urchin, but he possesses a supernatural strength that he uses for the welfare of his fellow man, or so his grandfather wishes. Much to his chagrin, his grandchild demands 10,000 yen for every good deed that he carries out. However, Jin's modest life is suddenly thrown into disarray when he encounters a player, a deadly entity possibly responsible for several mysterious murders.\n\nAs Jin attempts to navigate the situation by punching his way through every obstacle, a group of mysterious men desperately hunt down an individual with a ring-shaped mark on their hand. As they continue their investigation, various secrets surrounding the world begin to unravel—and it seems like Jin himself might be the solution to the puzzle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
