    "synopsis": "Mutsumi Soma has just arrived at the residence of his wife, Hinata Ashitaba, where he will begin living with her family—a household of six. However, the house is composed mainly of females who are all used to a lifestyle without the presence of a man.\n\nAnd thus, Hinata's mother, aunt, and two younger sisters will have to adjust to Mutsumi's entry into their family and learn to give him some personal space and privacy. But old habits die hard and Mutsumi soon realizes that life as an Ashitaba's husband is not easy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
