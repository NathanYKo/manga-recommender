    "synopsis": "Yuu's new high school is kind of awful. He's failing his classes and striking out socially. Everything changes when he finds one of Spider-Man's costumes abandoned in an alleyway. At first, it's fun to put on the costume and play hero, but when powerful enemies appear, Yuu quickly realizes he's out of his element. Still, with the real Spider-Man nowhere to be found, the city needs someone to save it...\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
