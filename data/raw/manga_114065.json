    "synopsis": "Young college student Junpei Shishido is quick to befriend others, even if they are from different departments. One day while exploring the campus, Junpei sees Leo Onizuka, an introverted student who looks oddly familiar. When he strikes up a conversation on their second encounter, Onizuka coldly claims that they have never met before and starts avoiding him at all costs.\n\nSoon after, Junpei coincidentally finds Onizuka's ID card and remembers how he knows Onizuka as well as his infamous nickname. His secret now revealed, Onizuka is certain that his college life is doomed; but to his surprise, Junpei decides to befriend him and keep quiet about his past, marking the beginning of a friendship between polar opposites. Gradually, the once unsociable Onizuka begins to break out of his shell while still staying true to himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
