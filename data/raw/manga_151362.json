    "synopsis": "Camellia was a flower born of a gutter rat, her face more ethereal than any other. When she was a child, a wealthy noblewoman took her and forced her to become Camellius Bale, the second-born son of House Bale. From that day on, her life was no longer her own.\n\nFor years, Camellius has lived to protect the position of her older brother, Kieran, even though this does not benefit her at all. With nowhere to run, she obeys her mother's orders, burying herself deep beneath a facade of lies. As she begins to cross paths with Claude del Ihar, the heir to the grand dukedom, she continues to hope that someday she can reclaim what was once hers—the life of Camellia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
