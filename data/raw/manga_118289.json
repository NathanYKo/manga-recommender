    "synopsis": "Having recently moved from her small backwater town in Ishikawa Prefecture to attend a prestigious high school in Tokyo, Mitsumi Iwakura plans on using her high school career as a launchpad for her dream of going to law school and becoming a public servant; however, she also recognizes the need to occasionally have fun and make friends. To that end, she has gone so far as to map out her entire life ahead of time, but all of her preparation flies out the window on the first day of school.\n\nMitsumi misses her train stop and is about to be late to the entrance ceremony, which is especially troublesome because she is supposed to give a speech as the new students' representative. While lamenting her situation, Sousuke Shima—a handsome first-year student who is also late—sees her and offers to walk with her  to school. They eventually make it to school, although Mitsumi has some unfortunate accidents soon after that leave a less-than-favorable impression on everyone. In spite of her misfortune, her classmates soon take notice of Mitsumi and Sousuke's chemistry, despite their differing personas.\n\nWith the new year already off to an interesting start, Mitsumi is eager to get to know her classmates better and get involved at her school. Only time will tell if this country bumpkin can make it in the city, but one thing has become certain: she definitely will not be alone on her journey!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
