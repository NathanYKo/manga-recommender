    "synopsis": "Akudama\nPromising young student Tadahiko Morisaki is being blackmailed over the petty crime of shoplifting pencil lead. It is his great misfortune that his first time was caught on camera by Youhei Harata, an older man with no meaningful relationships or passions in life. In exchange for withholding the evidence, Harata demands that Morisaki keep him company and entertain him. Whether asked to follow Harata to an amusement park or to a love hotel—Morisaki cannot refuse him anything. But as if one bad deed had diminished all his inhibitions, Morisaki gradually becomes less resistant toward their meetings.\n\nNonfiction\nKei Ichinose and Fumiyo Tabuchi are co-stars in a gay romance currently being filmed for television. When Fumiyo agrees to spend time with the inexperienced Ichinose outside of work, the latter's performance greatly improves. But Ichinose has not gotten any better at acting—the heightened chemistry between them is due to his genuine feelings for Fumiyo. Other than being sure of his own heart, Ichinose finds it unclear which parts of their relationship are only fiction.\n\nAn Ordinary Day\nIchinose and Fumiyo make plans to meet at a restaurant in Chiba on an ordinary day.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
