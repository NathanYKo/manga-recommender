    "synopsis": "Rinne is a girl who can see and exorcise ghosts (usually with a paper fan). When the school punk saves her from getting hit by a truck, but ends up in a coma himself, she, and his disembodied spirit must defend his prone body from being possessed by this, that and the other local spirits. Unfortunately, she fails in her task, and an ancient playboy takes over the punk's body, leaving him to inhabit a pink stuffed monkey. Hilarity ensues.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
