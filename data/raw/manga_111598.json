    "synopsis": "Bullied and ostracized, Shin Naerim is looking for a way out. She has no friends, never puts up a fight, and simply endures the pain. This all changes when Naerim meets Vlad Fetechou—a centuries-old vampire who unwittingly enters a blood pact with Naerim. The nature of their bond is one of a master and servant; whenever Naerim sheds blood, a red thread appears, binding the two together.\n\nFetechou's sole wish is to become human; the only way to accomplish this is to drink the blood of a witch, which Naerim just so happens to be. Growing closer each passing second, the pair learns to heal their own wounds as they face shattered friendships, strained familial bonds, and dreadful shadows from Fetechou's past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
