    "synopsis": "Tomo Mikage, a timid graduate student in the Botanical Department, has shut the door on love in order to keep himself from getting hurt. However, life has other plans in store, namely in the form of Youji Nanahoshi—a tall junior who studies in the same seminar as him. While he initially finds himself intimidated by his junior, Nanahoshi's soft and friendly demeanor breaks down Mikage’s defenses. After noticing the poor state of Nanahoshi’s well-being, Mikage offers Nanahoshi to become his roommate. By living under the same roof, love blooms between the two, and they confess their feelings for one another.\n\nAlthough they both lack experience in romance, Mikage and Nanahoshi are determined to make things work. As the two deepen their bond and navigate through uncharted territory, they gradually help each other come to terms with their respective insecurities.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
