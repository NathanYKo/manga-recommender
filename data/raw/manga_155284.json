    "synopsis": "Baengri Yeon knows her role well: she is a minor villain in a martial arts novel, scorned even for mourning the loss of her benevolent father, Euigang. But some villains possess the power to impact the story. The hero's archnemesis, Yayul, suddenly appears before Yeon and kills her, deviating from the original plot.\n\nHowever, Yeon awakens in her six-year-old body, traveling back in time to just after an accident that stops her from becoming a martial artist—a disgrace for a member of the esteemed Baengri clan. She is already used to the family's bullying and abuse, but now she wishes to at least improve her relationship with Euigang. By opening her heart to her father and striving to prevent his senseless death, Yeon realizes the true extent of Euigang's love for her—and even the family patriarch seems to soften at the sight of his adorable granddaughter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
