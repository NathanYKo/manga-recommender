    "synopsis": "Hotheaded and temperamental Madoka Tokumaru cannot seem to stop himself from breaking things with his brute strength. Fed up with Madoka's attitude, his younger sister, Nagomi, forces him to join the Tea Club to learn general etiquette and a sense of composure. Leading the club is the mature and handsome Kazuma Hasune, who is reluctant to take Madoka in as an apprentice. Likewise, Madoka is unable to grasp the nuances of a traditional tea ceremony, nor is he fond of Hasune's intense personality.\n \nWhile working at a club event, Madoka witnesses a theft in the club room. Realizing the thieves stole a priceless teacup that belonged to Hasune's late grandfather, Madoka goes on the offense to retrieve it. Though he manages to come out of the incident relatively unscathed, the cup nonetheless breaks in his possession. Having no means of compensating Hasune, the Tea Club head proposes an alternative form of payment—Madoka's body.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
