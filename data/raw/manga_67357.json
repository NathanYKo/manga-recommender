    "synopsis": "Yuu Akabane used to be a plain, shy girl, but she decided to change that when she entered Harumi High School. Now 16 years old, Akabane has her sights set on the \"White Prince\" of her school, Takumi Shirakawa. But wherever Shirakawa goes, Haruto Kurosaki, the \"Black Devil,\" isn't far behind. Because of Kurosaki's evil glare and bad disposition, no one can even get close to Shirakawa. \n\nOne day, as Akabane is moving into the school dormitory, she witnesses Kurosaki threatening another student for accidentally spitting gum in his hair. But when Shirakawa involves himself in the conflict, Akabane fears for his safety. Deciding to take charge, she cuts off Kurosaki's ponytail in an attempt to end the argument. However, all she really ends up doing is giving Kurosaki another target to bully: her. Kurosaki's idea of punishment is unconventional, to say the least, and each time he toys with her, he leaves her heart pounding. Can Akabane break free from the Black Devil and stay true to her feelings for the White Prince? Or will she keep falling for Kurosaki's devilish charms?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
