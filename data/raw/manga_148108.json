    "synopsis": "Paraplegic ex-sniper Ha Yiha is getting a fresh start in the VR game \"Middle Earth.\" He hopes to become a powerful player and earn enough money to afford surgery, but there's a small problem... an untimely logout leaves him playing as a musketeer, the game's most ineffective class. Luckily, he's able to use his real-life sharpshooting skills to take musketeering to new heights. As his unprecedented progress turns heads and prompts new quests, Yiha thinks he's got a shot at success, but he may have just landed himself directly in danger's sights.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
