    "synopsis": "At the age of sixteen Ryo Narushima was a genius and looked to have no trouble of getting into Tokyo University and joining the elite of society. However, that summer something cracked inside Ryo's head. With a small knife he brutally murdered both of his parents only leaving his sister alive and cowering in a corner. It is at this grotesque incident that our story begins.\n\n(Source: MU)",
    "background": "In 2004 the series moved from Manga Action to Evening, resetting the chapter count starting at volume 20. It was discontinued in 2007 due to authors creative differences but returned in 2011. Starting from volume 26, the first volume from when the series returned from a long hiatus, the series has been completely written and drawn by Akio Tanaka. While Izou Hashimoto did write the series in the beginning, he had been doing less and less work starting from volume 4. Tanaka and Hashimoto reached a settlement and Shamo continued. The series' first thirteen volumes were published in Spanish by Otakuland between 2003 and 2005.",
