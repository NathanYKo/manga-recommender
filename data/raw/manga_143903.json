Both have someone that they're interested in but can't seem to find a way to get closer to that special person. However, everything changes one summer day, when the power of...a (magical?!) bitter melon switches their bodies!! The two aren't complaining, though, because this is their chance to get closer to their crushes. Just how will the wacky duo manage to do so?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
