    "synopsis": "Leaving only black soot and dead bodies in his wake, Kang Chan, the \"God of Blackfield,\" struck fear into the hearts of his enemies. But one day, in the chaos of battle, his life was abruptly snuffed out. \"I've been shot... but the bullet came from behind me!\" Revived three years later, this \"god\" is now a wimpy high schooler with major problems—savage bullies, shady business dealings, and even girls. Revenge seemed like a straight shot, but high school is a battlefield all of its own!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
