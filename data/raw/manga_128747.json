    "synopsis": "Mayuki Yukshita is determined to go to the same high school as her crush Akira Hanamaki. Though Mayuki has fallen for Akira's intelligence and natural talent, the two are separated when Akira graduates and enrolls at Ootomo High. With her terrible grades, Mayuki stands no chance of passing Ootomo High's difficult entrance exams. Following Akira seems impossible.\n\nUpon seeing her determination to get into the school, Mayuki's mother hires Rin Mochizuki to be her tutor. Though their sessions start off normally, their dynamic changes when Rin discovers the true reason Mayuki wants to go to Ootomo. As their tutoring sessions become more intimate, Rin's heart starts to yearn for the girl she was hired to support. At the same time, Akira—who happens to be Rin's best friend—notices the change, and she develops an intense jealousy as Rin grows closer to Mayuki. No amount of tutoring can prepare Mayuki for this.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
