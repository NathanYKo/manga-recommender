    "synopsis": "In the year 1853, Commodore Mathew Perry—at the behest of the Holy Britannian Empire—demands the Tokugawa Shogun open Japan's borders to the world. The Shogun refuses, so Perry uses his supernatural power of absolute obedience known as \"Geass\" to force compliance. Foreign nations have since exploited Japan, redesignated the Britannian colony of Area 11. \n\nHowever, the terrorist organization known as the Black Revolution works to free Japan from Britannia's oppressive rule. Spearheading this endeavor is Lelouch Lamperouge, a boy who leads a double life as a Britannian commander and the leader of the Black Revolution under the alter ego Zero. \n\nWith robust forces, Lelouch secures victory after victory against the Britannians. But the appearance of a powerful, seventh generation Knightmare piloted by his best friend Suzaku Kururugi threatens to end his great revolution. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
