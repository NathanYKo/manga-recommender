    "synopsis": "There is a legend that speaks of the \"batsu,\" a god-like being with powers reminiscent of the sun, who saved humans from a relentless rainstorm. However, it was unbearable for normal people to stand in the presence of the batsu's scorching heat. Thus, he was banished to northern lands along with contracted helpers who would serve him until they died—or till he did.\n\nTheo begins his service with the batsu Rei after the previous master of the house, to whom Theo's mother was indentured, passes away. Theo recalls meeting Rei when they were both children, and he finds him to be just as beautiful now as he was back then. In his mind, life as a servant is worthwhile so long as he can stay beside the person he idolizes. However, as Theo and Rei become closer, their intimacy wreaks havoc on the latter's body; the stronger Theo's feelings for Rei are, the shorter their remaining time together may be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
