    "synopsis": "When Ageha was little she watched a tennis game and was affected by a passionate young tennis player. Years later she was determined to become a number one tennis player and to  join the tennis club in her new high school.\n\n Unexpectedly, on her first day of school she finds out that her new seat mate is none other than Takeru, the tennis player she was inspired from. But her excitement lasts shortly since Takeru turns out to be a jerk and he even gave up on tennis. When things couldn't turn worser, Ageha realises that there isn’t any tennis club in her school! Despite the unlucky start, she is still determined to create the Tennis Club and she works overnight for days to clean the tennis court all on her own. She also keeps practicing alone even though her rackets had been broken days before by Takeru. But her perseverance is slowly touching the boy. Surprisingly, he shows up during her training  dressed in a tennis gear. And he even gives  Ageha a new tennis racket and starts coaching her.  Is this the start of a new love on the tennis field?",
