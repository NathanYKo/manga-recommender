    "synopsis": "The world is under threat from interdimensional monsters, and only the chosen \"Awakened\"—humans possessed of special powers—can defeat them! Sure, it sounds exciting, but it's a far cry from reality for ordinary office worker Dohyeok Park, who's more worried about landing a big business deal that could save his job. That is, until one day when Dohyeok's path crosses a monster outbreak, causing him to manifest his true powers as a rare and powerful form of Awakened. With his newfound abilities attracting eager allies and powerful enemies, will Dohyeok find that he has what it takes to survive?\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
