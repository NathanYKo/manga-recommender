    "synopsis": "Some people would jump at the chance at a new life, but when Jeongyun wakes up after a terrible accident and finds that she has become Lecian Fucernien, a character of a cliche, romantic fantasy novel, it feels like she's woken up inside a nightmare. Disappointed as she is, she quickly accepts her fate and decides to make the best of her new life. The good news is that Lecian's character has a happy ending, but the bad news is that she's supposed to die once to get it. Between foiling her abusive new father's plans of committing treason, finding a way out of her engagement to the crown prince, and avoiding the strange duke who seems to be stalking her, Jeongyun has a very long to-do list. Will Jeongyun be able to adjust to her new life while figuring out a way to avoid dying a second time?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
