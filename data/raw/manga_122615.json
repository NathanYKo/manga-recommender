    "synopsis": "On the surface, Hayate Ichikura, Shun Futami, Takayuki Mima, and Souma Shiki do not have much in common apart from their good looks and seemingly suave attitudes. However, what they do share is an unexpected characteristic—they are quite clumsy! Whether it is losing a wallet, wearing clothes incorrectly, or getting lost, there is no short amount of antics the quartet gets up to. It is only a matter of pretending their mishaps are intentional and not losing their cool in front of others.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
