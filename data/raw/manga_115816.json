    "synopsis": "Yumi Tanaka is fed up with her office job. Despite pushing herself to stay committed, she feels her hard work is ignored and her colleagues ostracize her. On the brink of giving up, Yumi one day finds a discarded ragged doll; even in its current state, it continues to wear a smile. Seemingly relating to its condition, Yumi takes the doll home and mends it, naming it Kurumi. The tight-knit relationship the two come to form may just be the string of happiness Yumi needs to stitch together her path to a brighter future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
