    "synopsis": "Miroku is a slit-mouthed woman whose ear-to-ear smile strikes fear into the superstitious, but who would have thought she had a fiancé? Once an infamous urban legend, the self-proclaimed \"Queen of Folklore\" has found her existence threatened by the public's declining belief in her. She is also roped into a contractual marriage with 17-year-old Kouichi Sano, a member of a family responsible for the continued existence of the supernatural.\n\nMiroku is unenthused by the arrangement and wishes to regain her notoriety through her own means. For this reason, Sano makes his fiancée a deal: if she can scare him once before he turns 18, he will end the engagement. Miroku concedes to these terms but is unsettled by Sano's proposed condition—where he must make her fall in love with him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kuchi ga Saketemo Kimi ni wa was serialized in the free online magazine Shounen Jump+, unlike the first two installments. The series was published digitally in English as Even If You Slit My Mouth through MANGA Plus. It has also been released in Polish by Waneko since January 18, 2024.",
