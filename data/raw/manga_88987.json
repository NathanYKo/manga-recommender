    "synopsis": "\"I can't be loved for who I am—that's what I thought, but somehow he saw through my lies?!\"\n\nChitose has always done well wearing her face like a mask: always smiling, always cute. She feels complete whenever she put it on because it's built to hide her unrefined self: no one hates her, and no one makes fun of her. But after meeting a cute boy who is instinctively more annoyed by her mask than her real self, can Chitose change and make people accept her for who she really is?\n\n(Source: Otakumole)",
