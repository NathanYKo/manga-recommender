Despite her loving family's nudges and encouragement, she has so far failed all her job interviews. Life is never more difficult as the unemployed NEET spends her anxiety-filled days holed up in her home, trying to avoid judgmental gazes and despairing at the success of others.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
