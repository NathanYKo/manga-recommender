Upon arriving, Inugami finds a young boy named Kabane working in the fields and quickly befriends him, eventually bringing him on to help solve the case.\n\nAs the two get closer to the truth, Inugami's suspicion that Kabane is more than human begins to grow stronger and he decides to employ the boy at his detective office, dedicated to solving cases related to the supernatural.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
