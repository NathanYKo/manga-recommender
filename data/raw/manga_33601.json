    "synopsis": "Mashikaku Rock\nMiyako Kitagawa always lives by her father's words to obey rules. With the goal of performing flawlessly at school, she aspires to eventually land a well-paying job. However, beneath her diligence for a consistent life is her passion for rock music. When her seemingly aloof classmate, Koutarou Azuma, pulls Miyako into joining his rock band, her outlook for her future begins to change. Faced with a difficult decision, Miyako needs to ask herself whether strict rules are worth neglecting for a hobby she has covertly indulged in for a long time—all while being troubled by her feelings toward Azuma.\n\nTonari no Hanako-san\nIn his final year of high school, a boy ponders about his seatmate, who seems to have passed away. Without knowing her face nor her real name, he calls her Hanako and holds onto memories of the girl he once met. At first, their encounter seemed like a chance one, but somehow her voice still lingers within his heart. \n\nSayonara Sankaku\nNoto Natsuo, Maruya Haruichi, and Nishizake Shuusuke have been friends ever since they were little kids. But one day, an unexpected confession on the school rooftop changes their childhood relationship completely. Tangled in their now complicated triangle, they attempt to work things out and understand each other. \n\nTsui Me de Otteshimaimashita.\nFor Hazuki Nakano, Youta Murakami's blonde hair stands out so much that it always catches her attention. Yet, despite being annoyed by its bright dazzling color, she cannot help but keep her eyes on him. From the outside, Murakami looks all lighthearted and flamboyant. But as she follows him more, Hazuki soon discovers another side of Murakami—which may just cause her to fall in love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
