    "synopsis": "I'm Yuuji Tomoki, a normal second-year student in high school. Perfectly normal, if not for the fact that everyone avoids me like the plague because I look like I'm out for blood. The only exception is the typical novel protagonist chad Haruma Ike. But one day, his sister Touka confessed to me! This chick just met me yesterday, what's she going on about?! In any case, I decided to be her fake boyfriend on account of my friendship with Haruma. But now even Haruma's idol-tier childhood friend and a smoking hot teacher is getting involved with me?! Hold up, this ain't a romcom wet dream! I mean, there's no way a sidekick like me could be popular, right?\n\n(Source: Overlap, translated)",
