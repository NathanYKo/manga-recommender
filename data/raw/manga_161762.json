    "synopsis": "The new game Murderer of Pflatzgraff Manor has received recognition for its fascinating graphics, but its extreme difficulty—characterized by the high likelihood of dying and having to reset after every minor action—has compelled players to demand their money back. The plot follows the almighty Satan, condemned by Lilith to live as a mere human in a sickly body. Her curse demands that he continuously kill without being caught, simply to prolong his fragile existence. A Korean woman considers giving up on the bothersome game before she suddenly awakens as Hilda, one of Count Adrian Kaiser von der Pflatzgraff's many maids.\n\nAlthough Hilda considers the game nothing but a chaotic cluster of pixels, she would hate to have Adrian slash her throat as he stares at her with his cold, sadistic eyes. Though she must refrain from being alone with Adrian, her unfortunate task is to personally bring the young master his medicine every single day. Terrified to her core, Hilda must use somewhat believable excuses to protect her fellow maids without ever raising Adrian's suspicions—for if she allows anyone to die, this game may never properly end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
