    "synopsis": "In 1999, a meteorite crashed into Antarctica. The impact melted the continental ice mass and drastically raised sea levels, damaging the world's climate and causing the deaths of over half its population. Now in 2015, devastating creatures of unknown origin—referred to as Angels—ravage what remains of the planet.\n\nIn the heavily fortified city of Tokyo-3, 14-year-old Shinji Ikari is destined to halt the Angels' onslaught. Recruited by his father's secret organization, NERV, Shinji is enlisted as a pilot of an Evangelion, a massive bioorganic android created solely to defeat the Angels.\n\nSuddenly with the weight of the world upon his shoulders, Shinji must find the courage and drive to stand up for the future—and himself. But as skirmishes between the Evangelions and Angels become recurrent, the horrifying truth of the world is slowly revealed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Shinseiki Evangelion was initially serialized in Shounen Ace but moved to Young Ace on July 7, 2009. Although it was set to be released just shortly before the anime series began airing, production delays pushed the anime's airing date to 10 months later. The series was published in English as Neon Genesis Evangelion by VIZ Media from December 1998 to May 2003 for seven volumes. The publisher rereleased the manga under the Action imprint from February 25, 2004, to February 10, 2015, and in 3-in-1 omnibus volumes from November 13, 2012, to June 14, 2016. It was also released in Spanish by Norma Editorial from May 2003 to January 2015; in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora JBC from November 2001 to December 2014; and in Italian by Panini Comics from October 18, 2001, to November 22, 2014.",
