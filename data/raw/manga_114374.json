    "synopsis": "In 2006, a patient of a psychologist in New York sketched the portrait of a man she had repeatedly seen in her dreams. After several other patients claimed to have seen the same person in their dreams, the image was made public. Soon, there were reports from many others around the world who claimed that the same man appeared in their sleep. \"This Man\"—as he came to be known—eventually became nothing more than an urban legend.\n\nIn present-day Japan, forensic sketch artist Hakaru Amano uses his illustration skills to assist the Kumamoto Metropolitan Police. His life, however, changes when he meets Hoshiko Akesato, who approaches Hakaru in hopes that he can draw the man that appeared outside her home the week before. When he finishes his sketch, he is surprised to see that it is the same face as This Man.\n\nNot long afterward, Hoshiko witnesses This Man brutally murder her mother while Hakaru's apartment is set on fire. When the artist finally encounters This Man outside his building, Hakaru is given an ominous warning that death awaits those who lay eyes on This Man. When it becomes clear that the mysterious perpetrator has allies within the city, Hakaru and Hoshiko are forced into hiding. Nevertheless, Hakaru resolves to hunt down and capture This Man and his accomplices before they can strike again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
