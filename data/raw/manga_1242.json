    "synopsis": "Nao Yoshikawa stays behind to live by herself when her parents leave to inherit her grandpa's farm in the country. On the day she moves into her new apartment she soon discovers that it was rented also to Hisashi Uehara—a cute, super-cool and popular guy from her school. Not only did their housing agency unexpectedly close down, the landlord of the apartment tells them that they had to pay more for their apartment then they had expected. With both no money and no home to return to, Nao and Hisashi decide to live together as flatmates.\n\n(Source: ANN)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Kare to Kanojo ni Hanataba wo (His and Her Fortune Bouquet)",
