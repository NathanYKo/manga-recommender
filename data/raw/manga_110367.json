    "synopsis": "Typical first-year student Ayato Sanada is fond of photography. Joining the Okuma West High School's photography club, he meets a lazy and carefree second-year named Kazuki Shindou. However, with the club not having participated in any activities since the previous year, Kazuki begins to bring Ayato along with her to take photos of everyday life in and around their school.\n\nFutari no Jikan follows Ayato's journey in dealing with Kazuki's ideas for the club, with Kazuki knowing no boundaries at all. Nevertheless, as Ayato engages in Kazuki's activities, the two of them grow closer to each other as time passes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
