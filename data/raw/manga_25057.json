    "synopsis": "Akemi Toudou, a young office worker, has a little game she likes to play during her commute. She will take a seat next to a male on the bus, and if she can get him to look at her twice, then she wins. Up until now, she has always come out victorious, but to up the ante, she chooses a middle school boy as her next opponent. To her surprise, he doesn't spare her a single glance. \n\nIncited by his indifference, she sits next to him again; but no matter what she tries, he always ignores her. Must she admit defeat and declare the game over?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots: Yukai no Susume, Kedama no Cake, Kinou Kenka wo Shimashita.",
