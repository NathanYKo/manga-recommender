    "synopsis": "After Nozomi Aizawa follows her crush, Shirou Azuma, from school all the way to the train station, she finally musters the courage to confess to him. Instead of being a romantic moment, she receives an unexpected response from the boy, which progresses into a heated debate between the two.\n\nFrom that point forward, Nozomi and Shirou continue to meet at the train station and often end up arguing about their opinions on romance or the opposite gender. There is tension in their relationship, but as they carry on with these trivial yet precious conversations, the distance between the two awkward teenagers gradually closes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Miracle☆Gift",
