    "synopsis": "Ageha Shiroi suffers from a massive sister complex. When she discovers that her sister Hibari is pregnant and getting married in less than a month, she refuses to accept it. After a chance encounter with two beautiful men, Ageha accompanies Hibari to the bridal boutique Velvet Blue Rose (V.B. Rose), where she discovers those very same men are responsible for running the store!\n\nTogether, Yukari Arisaka and Mitsuya Kuromine design and create wedding dresses, with the aim to make their customers as satisfied as possible. Yet Ageha is still unhappy about her sister's impending marriage, and her bad attitude causes Yukari to kick her out of the store.\n\nThe next day, Ageha goes back to apologize, but after she loses her temper again, Mitsuya's hand gets injured as a result. Possessing a gift for making fashionable accessories, Ageha volunteers to help finish Hibari's wedding dress in place of Mitsuya. Before she knows it, she is thrown into the world of wedding dresses, reigniting dreams that she has had all her life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
