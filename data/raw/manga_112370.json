You could just sit in your room all day and all night and study and wonder why you never get asked out...OR, if you're Amy Song you could join up with the Spirit Fingers—the strangest, hippest, coolest (yet most welcoming) art club ever. But as Amy is about to learn, discovering your TRUE colors is about more than just painting.\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
