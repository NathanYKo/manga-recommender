    "synopsis": "Kouta Higashiyama is the estranged son of an enormously wealthy corporate founder—and his twenty-third mistress! Kouta thinks the issue of succession and inheritance has nothing to do with him, until his father's condition worsens and Kouta's suddenly kidnapped to become the next chairman. Before him are five beautiful girls, all in contention to become his lover—and each with her own agenda. It's up to Kouta to investigate and choose who he wants...but with his hands full from the girls' advances, will he really be the one controlling the board, or will he become a pawn instead?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
