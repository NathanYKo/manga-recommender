    "synopsis": "College student Keiji has always been a bit of an oddity. Born with the gift of being able to see the red string of fate, it is a blessing that he has learned to understand is really a curse. He has spent years watching relationships crumble, watching with knowing eyes when a couple's fingers are bound to someone else, and he still blames himself for the careless words that tore his family apart.\n\nAfter nursing a one-sided crush on his friend Yui for two years, Keiji notices that his string has finally connected. Following it, he finds his finger joined to that of underclassman Hiroki Obata. After several frustrating meetings, Keiji decides to rid himself of Hiroki once and for all and get himself back on track pursuing Yui. If that means ruining his chance at ever finding another soulmate, then so be it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
