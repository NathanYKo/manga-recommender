    "synopsis": "After 28 long years, the desolate territory of Pervaz finally triumphs over the Lore tribe. The commander who led them to victory is Asha Pervaz Del Amir, the only surviving member of the Pervaz family. But Asha's worries do not end. Her people are on the verge of starvation, and the only way to save them is to claim the payment that the emperor had promised her late father.\n\nHowever, the emperor never intended to honor his word. Instead, he offers Asha a different kind of reward: a husband of her choosing. Asha has no use for a man, but she cleverly picks Duke Carlisle Haven Evaristo—the emperor's son who recently lost his right as an heir. Realizing that a three-year contract marriage benefits them both, Asha and Carlisle move to Pervaz. While Asha receives the means to revive her domain, Carlisle gains a place to lie low until the moment he can recover his title and rise to the throne.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
