    "synopsis": "With her sole hobbies being reading and cooking, Tsukina Mizumori is a lonesome woman in her 30s who keeps to herself. As such, she unsurprisingly rejects the offer of becoming a savior for another world after being summoned by an orb that calls itself God. Despite growing out of bothersome adventures, Tsukina has no choice but to do what It says—though not before being given a few benefits to make her life easier.\n\nWith the help of a magic pendant, Tsukina is able to start her own book cafe on the outskirts of town. Her first customer ends up being Il Soeil—captain of the Knights of Othel and a fellow bookworm. Exhausted from dealing with the other savior, who prefers to spend her time with the prince instead of learning spells, Il comes to appreciate the charming business and soon takes a liking to the owner.\n\nFor three months, Tsukina is content with her peaceful life and her status as an anonymous savior. However, when God grants her a visit to warn her about the other savior, the otherwise self-assured bibliophile might not be able to hide her secret any longer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
