    "synopsis": "Dying from cancer and unhappy with how she has lived, 37-year-old Kang Jiwon catches her husband of 10 years—Park Minhwan—in bed with her best friend Jeong Sumin. In the ensuing confrontation, Minhwan becomes enraged and injures his wife, unremorseful even in her last moments as he allows her to bleed out. Feeling betrayed from the injustice she has endured for years, Jiwon is somehow reincarnated as her youthful 27-year-old self, a decade before her fateful death at the hand of her husband.\n\nWith feelings of resentment, vengeance, and rage, Jiwon uses the knowledge of her past life to set straight all the wrongs and misfortunes she suffered as a result of her cheating husband and fake best friend. She will stop at nothing to make their lives as miserable as possible. But between acts of revenge, there is the potential for Jiwon to meet a more worthy lover this time around.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
