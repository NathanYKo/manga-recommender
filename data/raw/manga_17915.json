    "synopsis": "Hiroyuki \"Hiro\" Sakurai is jealous that his brother Atsuya is dating his childhood crush, Hikari. However, his envious ways lead to the unintentional killing of his brother. Two years later, Hiro finds himself handcuffed in a pitch-black room, wearing a rabbit mask, and unsure of his captor's identity. Suddenly, eight other people in animal masks enter the room, and \"Judge\" commences: a twisted game where nine participants must judge each other's sins and decide who will be spared from deathâ€”and only four can leave. Aside from his own survival, Hiro needs to figure out who he can trust, why he was chosen to participate, and how his actions impact those around him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
