    "synopsis": "After being featured as a model in a popular fashion magazine, Nanaki Fujishiro feels positive that she is the most attractive girl in the world. Looking down on those who fail to put effort into their appearance—like her shy classmate Kanade Kurokawa—Nanaki goes through school life prioritizing looks above all else, surrounding herself with popular and attractive friends as well as an equally appealing boyfriend. Because she believes that her beauty will lead her to success, the last thing Nanaki expects is for one of her friends to reveal that Nanaki's boyfriend is cheating. Confronting him only leads to Nanaki being dumped, insulted, and left a crying mess until Kanade falls out of a nearby storage locker after overhearing the whole ordeal.\n\nKanade, having planned to live a peaceful, insignificant school life, is just as startled as Nanaki. Despite how Nanaki has treated her in the past, Kanade feels sympathy for the popular girl's heartbreak, and her first instinct is to comfort her. Against all odds, Nanaki and Kanade slowly grow closer to each other and more distant from everyone else. As Nanaki introduces Kanade to the world of fashion and comes to better understand Kanade's otaku lifestyle, new feelings emerge that neither of them could have anticipated.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
