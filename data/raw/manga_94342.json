    "synopsis": "Shino Kishibe is a 17-year-old high school student. Her parents died, and then six months ago, so did her older brother, her only remaining blood relative. Now she lives with her brother's wife, Nozomi-san. \"We might not be blood-related, but we're family.\" The story they write is a bit clumsy but full of something inexplicable. Slowly but surely, they happily grow together through their sensitive everyday life.\n\n(Source: Square Enix)",
