    "synopsis": "Shik-nam is a student that's obsessed with his grades and studying, so much so that, for him, solving problems and equations can reach erotic levels. Needless to say, his interest in anything other than his studies is near zero.\n\nThen comes a complication. The animal kingdom is furious with what the world has become, so they sent Yegrinna, the dog princess, to punish the sinful humans for dirtying the world by turning them into animals. And out of all the places she appears, it's at our unfortunate protagonist's room.\n\nWhat awaits Shik-nam and Yegrinna now that their fateful meeting has set into motion plans long since in wait?\n\n(Source: MU)",
