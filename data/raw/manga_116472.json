    "synopsis": "Shimizu Makoto, a team leader at an industrial firm, leads a fulfilling life as the work is both rewarding and pays well. However, she indulges in an embarrassing pastime: creating girls love doujinshi she sells at conventions.\n\nThough Shimizu does her best to keep this hobby hidden from her colleagues, a chance encounter at a doujin convention leads her coworker Akane Maekawa to learn of her secret. Much to Shimizu's surprise, Maekawa seems interested in learning moreâ€”even visiting Shimizu's apartment to borrow DVDs.\n\nAs the two girls grow closer, Shimizu discovers the value of sharing one's passion with someone else, all while attempting to figure out her complicated feelings toward Maekawa.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
