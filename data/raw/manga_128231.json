    "synopsis": "Due to widespread bullying in Eunjang High School, weak students live in constant fear of becoming the next prey. But their luck is bound to change when Gray Yeon—a scrawny freshman, no taller than 157 cm—leaves the entire class in shock—stands up to a bully twice his size and overpowers him with ease.\n\nGray's courageous act, resourcefulness, and unique insight earn him the nickname Eunjang's White Mamba. Despite his size, Gray continues trading blows with bigger and stronger bullies from other high schools in town, all in hopes of preventing history from repeating itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
