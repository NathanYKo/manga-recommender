    "synopsis": "The Quincies's Thousand Year Blood War is over, but the embers of turmoil still smolder in the Soul Society. Tokinada Tsunayashiro, elevated to head of his clan after a slew of assassinations take out every other claimant to the title, has a grand plan to create a new Soul King. His dark ambitions soon sow the seeds of a new total war across the realms, but all is not lost. There is one unlikely Soul Reaper who holds the key to defusing the conflictâ€”Shuhei Hisagi, assistant captain of the Ninth Company and reporter for the Seireitei Bulletin!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
