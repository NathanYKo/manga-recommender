    "synopsis": "Contracted with a no-name spirit, Brigitte Meidell is a disappointment to her noble family and the mockery of her peers at the Otoleanna Academy of Magic—except for one. Yuri Aurealis is intelligent, handsome...and oh so arrogant. He's made enemies of the same people as Brigitte, meaning the two should get along just fine. However, his boorishness accidentally sparks a rivalry between them. It's a competition that has the potential to bring the two closer than they ever thought...!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
