    "synopsis": "Shyness and insecurities can hold a person back, and this is especially true for 28-year-old woman Yuumi Yamamoto who has no dating experience. Nonetheless, she meets the cool and handsome 32-year-old man named Kanata Inoue through a mutual friend. A spark forms between them, and not long after they first meet, they start dating.\n\nInoue is calm and confident, always quick to say the right thing. But little does Yamamoto know that Inoue's inner feelings are the complete opposite! In fact, he has never liked anyone else before, and simply being around Yamamoto flusters him to no end. As he tries to maintain composure around his cute girlfriend, Inoue makes sure to reassure Yamamoto and help erase any doubts. Over time, the lovely couple may realize that no amount of prior experience matters in the face of the one they love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
