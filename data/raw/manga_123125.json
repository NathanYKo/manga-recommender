    "synopsis": "Bullying has become so common that it is often overlooked, but when bullies resort to excessive verbal abuse and physical violence, authorities usually step in to stop these situations. However, Hana Shirosaki is met with an unfortunate case that is the complete opposite. Her classmate Nakajima takes extreme pleasure in bullying and publicly humiliates her in the most appalling ways imaginable.\n\nBy instilling fear and resorting to blackmail, Nakajima intimidates the people around him to turn a blind eye to his dreadful deeds. Even if a brave soul tries to stand up against Nakajima, their efforts would only amount to nothing, as no one would dare support their endeavor. While Nakajima's gruesome actions are far beyond depravity and long past forgiveness, the secrets that lie behind his demeanor are more repulsive than one could ever think possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
