    "synopsis": "In a world of fantasy creatures and dreadful monsters, the Hunters Guild, a large agency of mercenaries, welcomes dangerous jobs of slaughtering beasts for money. Though many rumors are spread about the greed of the hunters, no one can deny that the job always ends up being done.\n\nWhen a small hamlet is plagued by a man-eating werewolf amongst its citizens, the mayor hires a hunter to take it down. Grimm—the hunter who arrives—leaves the villagers in doubt due to her childlike appearance, but, as they have no alternative, they pray that she lives up to the guild's reputation.\n\nVelou, whose parents were eaten by a werewolf when he was young, wishes to join the hunt but is deemed too inexperienced. However, when tasked with guiding Grimm through the forests and eventually fighting the werewolf alongside her, he is invited to join the Hunters Guild. Though Velou finds the offer to exterminate werewolves enticing, he still worries about his hamlet. Grimm, intent on recruiting new hunters into the guild, decides to put his worries to rest.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Yadokari no Kuni (The Land of Hermit Crabs), Myakunashi (No Hope, No Pulse)\nVolume 3: Red Hood (pilot)",
