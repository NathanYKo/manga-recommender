    "synopsis": "In this world, your \"Post\" is your life's calling. Only you can do it. You have to do it. You have no choice but to do it.\n\nTolza Godolschleim is a \"Slayer,\" a person whose predetermined Post destines him to fight against \"Demons.\" According to his superiors, a Slayer's strength lies in the number of his allies. However, compared to his contemporaries, Tolza recruits relatively few team members. The individuals that travel with him are skilled enough that he rarely has to draw his own sword, but it is not confidence in their abilities that causes him to be strangely selective about who can join him. The truth is something that the public can never be allowed to know.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
