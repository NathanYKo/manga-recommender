    "synopsis": "Some of the chapters are just about sex, often in public places, but that isn't all Maka-Maka is about. It's about having someone who tells you your skin looks beautiful in the moonlight, someone who looks out for you and wants you to look out for yourself by having safe sex. It's about having someone who calls you the night of your birthday, when you're feeling down because you just slept with a guy who turned out to be a jerk, and thanks you for being born because she's so happy to have met you. What is Maka-Maka about? It's about Jun and Nene.\n\n(Source: Lilicious)",
