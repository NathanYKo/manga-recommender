    "synopsis": "If life's a game, then Ah-in's always been a loser. Growing up in an orphanage left him poor and emotionally scarred, but now he's determined to bypass the rat race and get rich quick. In his job as a gay masseur, Ah-in has a unique selling point: he pretends to be blind, offering his wealthy, powerful clients total confidentiality. One such client is Seo Ilmo, a mystery novelist with a spotless reputation and a dangerous compulsion. And when Ah-in pays a visit to Mr. Seo's apartment for an appointment, a fatal game of cat and mouse begins. This time, however, Ah-in cannot afford to be the loser...\n\n(Source: Lezhin Comics)",
