    "synopsis": "The infamous Portgas D. Ace's departure from Dawn Island marks the beginning of his pirate adventure, and he immediately finds himself deserted on an uninhabited, desolate island. There, he meets a mysterious man, who quickly becomes drawn to Ace's personality and befriends him. Aiming to get themselves off the island, the duo decides to work together to build a boat.\n\nHowever, due to a lack of food on the isle, the pair only have so much time to finish making their craft, causing tension to arise between the two. Nonetheless, the appearance of a special fruit may give them the hope needed to escape the islandâ€”because if they succeed, they vow to sail the Grand Line together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Roronoa Zoro, Umi ni Chiru (Zolo Overboard)\nVolume 2: Nami vs. Kalifa",
