Nothing could ever shake their unbreakable friendship—until they share a kiss. Although Yi-hyeok quickly writes it off as just another one of Inseo's impulsive acts, he hates to admit just how much he loves it.\n\nAs Yi-hyeok and Inseo mindlessly continue to indulge the new, unfamiliar side of their relationship, Yi-hyeok wonders if it is truly the behavior of two people who are just friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
