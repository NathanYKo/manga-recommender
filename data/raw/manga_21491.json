    "synopsis": "2nd-year middle school student Ayumu Kurihara changes classes and is seated next to the beautiful but strange Misuzu Tsukishima who dislikes boys. Mizusu can't get close to other people, but after being moved by Ayumu's sweet, honest personality she begins to open up to her little by little. Ayumu too is captivated by the awkwardly delicate Mizusu and the two of them become close.\n\n(Source: Taciturnity Scans)",
