One day a particular girl, Iwashita Ayane, catches his attention in cram school, because of her red fingernail. Later in town he sees a familiar girl and follows her. But the girl enters an image club. A brothel that specializes on cosplay. What's more, one of the girls working there goes by the name of \"Ayane.\" What does that mean? And what will Wataru do?\n\n(Source: MU)",
