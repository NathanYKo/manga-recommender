But this changes all of a sudden when every friday at the fifth hour, scholars are chosen to fight directly at the frontlines.\n\nBoth Saku and Miyako are declared unfit for service for undisclosed reasons. However, young Reina, who had just fled Tokyo, is first to be sent to the war zone.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
