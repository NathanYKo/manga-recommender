While standing on floating circular platforms, players must defeat their opponents by using only their breasts and buttocks. Drawn into this female-only sport in hopes of making a fortune and escaping poverty, 17-year-old Nozomi Kaminashi decides to abandon her gymnastics career to apply for the Setouchi Keijo Training School alongside Sayaka Miyata, her new friend and former judo athlete. In the upcoming exam, the girls will have to utilize the utmost of their abilities to qualify as students of the school. With only the final goal in mind, Nozomi and Sayaka steel themselves to compete against participants from all over the country.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
