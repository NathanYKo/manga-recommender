    "synopsis": "Nana has no memory of his childhood earlier than age 12 when a store owner took him in and named him Nana, meaning no-name in Japanese. Mitsuha is on a quest to find a missing childhood friend. The two meet when Mitsuha ends up crashing at Nana’s place at the insistence of a mutual friend. At first Nana loathes the very existence of Mitsuha. However, he gradually warms up to his sincerity and kindness and finds happiness in awakening beside him. \n\n(Source: DMP)",
