    "synopsis": "(1) - (4)\nYou Make My Head Spin (Chapters 1 - 4)\n   As a transfer student to a rough, run-down school populate by delinquents, Shindou tries his best to make friends.  When he meets the ill-mannered Yousuke, heartbeats and tempers start to fly!  It seems Yousuke is a \"tsundere\"--his gruff exterior hides a shy, sensitive side--and Shindou immediately finds himself dizzy over his combative new crush.  Can Yousuke accept a relationship that goes against his tough-guy image?  Or will his tendency to lash out at everyone around him drive even the earnest Shindou away for good?\n   Yousuke and Shindou's back-and-forth bickering is enough to cause their friends to suffer vertigo just trying to follow along.  But with every fight comes the chance to make up again--and for this couple there's definitely no exception! (Source: June edition back cover)\n\n(5) - (6)\nSensei! Parts 1 and 2\nExtra school-based story",
