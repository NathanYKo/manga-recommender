    "synopsis": "Daisuke Suwa is a reserved high school student who lives with his widowed mother in a faraway rural town. At school, he behaves like a womanizer who is interested in all girls except the shy Hinako Aikawa, whom he claims is pretending to be a \"sweet virgin.\" One day, Daisuke gets caught up in an argument between two of his admirers and seeks shelter in a church. He hides inside a confessional, only for Hinako to enter the church and mistake his voice as that of a priest. She asks for him to listen to her confession, to which he has no choice but to comply.\n\nHinako divulges that she was sexually abused by her step-father while she was still in junior high school, which led to her giving up a baby boy for adoption. Now aware of her secrets, Daisuke can't help but empathize with her. However, as the pair become closer, can his compassion turn into something more?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
