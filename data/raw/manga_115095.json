    "synopsis": "For Kanoko Mikeda, dating and a love life had always remained out of reach. Having only attended all-girls schools, she has always wondered about the everlasting mystery behind boys. Hoping to finally leave innocence behind, she decides to enroll in a co-ed high school.\n\nAmongst the sea of new faces, one boy draws Kanoko's attention. Reserved and aloof, Yuito Tamako's eccentric personality initially puts Kanoko off. But she soon discovers a charming and good-natured side to him: he is as inexperienced in love as she is. As Kanoko's experience comes solely from fantasies and romance shows, she now faces a different challenge when approached with real feelings for the first time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 5: Yamenaide, Kirara-kun",
