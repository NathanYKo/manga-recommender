    "synopsis": "Komomo Ninomiya spent her childhood living like a princess. Surrounded by doting servants and delicious sweets, she led a satisfied life, yet still yearned the love of her parents, who were always too busy to see her. In times of loneliness, she found solace in pastries made by Natsu Azumi, the five-year-old son of the family chef. Natsu's confections were neither particularly tasty nor pretty, yet they filled Komomo with overwhelming warmth.\n\nAfter Natsu leaves with his father for France, Komomo spends the next 10 years in the familiar lap of luxury, until her father's business goes bankrupt. Demoted from a super princess to super poor, Komomo must now work part-time jobs to get by, but her stubborn personality results in her being fired time and time again. Her fortunes begin to change after a chance encounter with Natsu for the first time in a decade, who offers her a job at his confectionery \"Méli-Mélo.\"\n\nThe current Natsu is entirely different from how he used to be: he works Komomo to the bone and berates her for mistakes made. Only his confections have not changed, still suffusing her with the same warmth. With their positions as master and servant reversed, what awaits the two-faced patissier and spoiled princess?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
