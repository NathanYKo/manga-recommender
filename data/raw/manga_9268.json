    "synopsis": "Havoc strikes medieval Europe as many people suddenly turn into horrifying man-eating dolls called Guignols. The disease is seemingly incurable, and the epidemic is so unstoppable that any remaining Guignol bodies must immediately be burned to prevent its spread. Despite it all, a traveling music troupe called the Grand Orchestra roams around the land. Its three members consist of the beautiful virtuoso Lucille, the hotheaded gun enthusiast Kohaku, and the orchestra's quiet car driver, Gwindel, who has a soft spot for hedgehogs.\n\nAfter arriving in the town of Touissant at the request of the local Lord Heliodor, the group receives scrutiny from its residents for not being conscripted to stop the Guignols. In particular, the lord's music-hating, disabled son, Elestial, seems to detest the group. Despite the hostility, the orchestra continues with its planned concert while investigating both the suspicious circumstances and Elestial's apparent disdain as his fate continues to intertwine with the group's adventures.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 5: Camelot Garden",
