    "synopsis": "Yamada Hiroyuki is 26 years old, has a stable job, is an otaku, but is overwhelmed by the ideas and thoughts of his family, i.e. marriage and criticism over his childish hobbies. He decides to leave the house and go to live in an apartment, alone and happy, but the perfect image he had in mind when he moved in was destroyed when he learned that his neighbor is a yankee schoolgirl. However he soon discovers her real personality is quite awkward and very tender. Will the story of these two advance for the better?\n\n(Source: MU)",
