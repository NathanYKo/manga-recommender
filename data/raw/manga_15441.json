    "synopsis": "Volume 1:\nMizuno Chihiro was unable to control his urges and got erect very easily. Because of his constant tardiness, he was sent to participate in the re-development system together with two other problematic senpai, Takatou Shinobu and Kandori Akira. Sharing a room with Takatou, Mizuno became erect when he helped Takatou (a mangaka) on his smutty works. Takatou tried his best to help Mizuno but fell in love with Mizuno along the way. However, he refused to admit his own feelings and hurts Mizuno. What should Mizuno do?\n\nVolume 2:\nV2 focused on the love triangle of Takamura Harumichi, Kandori Akira and Takamura's aniki, Akuda Shuuji. Kandori finally found out what really happened during that winter three years ago. With Takamura's confession, would Kandori accept it and move on? And with the help of Kandori sensei, would Takatou Shinobu finally become one with Mizuno Chihiro? \n\n(Source: MU)",
