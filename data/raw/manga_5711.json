    "synopsis": "Fire, smoke, adrenaline, and fear—when everyone is running to escape from a fire, a few courageous people are running to jump right into the thick of it. Firefighters put their own lives on the line to protect others and Daigo Asahina has always dreamed of becoming one. He's fresh out of the training academy and has been newly assigned to Medaka-Ga-Hama fire station. Cocky and overconfident, Daigo responds to a few calls and is quickly humbled and put in his place—he's still got a lot to learn before he can call himself a true firefighter.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
