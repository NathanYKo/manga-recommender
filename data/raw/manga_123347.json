    "synopsis": "Once upon a time, witches and humans lived in harmony. However, when human society was at its lowest point, the humans blamed the witches for their misfortunes and decided to burn them at the stake. For the sake of survival, the remaining witch population allied with those who desire to take advantage of their powers.\n\nCenturies later, after the general public had forgotten about the existence of witches, a school named Sternenlichtl was built to house and teach young witches. There, Alice Keating is a renowned witch with budding potential—having already mastered most types of magic. When new student Mari Muguruma, who has no experience with witches and magic, is transferred to the school, Alice is given the task of educating her on everything she needs to know.\n\nHaving shown no aptitude towards anything she is taught, Alice struggles to see any worth in Mari. Yet, following an emotional outburst, Mari subconsciously uses her magic on something that requires a vast amount of skill: resurrection magic. Finally able to see why she was brought to the school, Alice dedicates more of her time to teaching Mari. But with Alice focusing so much attention on her, Alice's friends begin to get jealous; and it seems that they are willing to do anything to get rid of Mari.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
