Each musician has different reasons to play, be it love for the music, a strong desire to surpass their fears on stage or even just for someone's approbation.\nWhile these bands are struggling to be known in such a competitive world, Kenta is struggling with a different problem in his love life; can he be a replacement for someone else?\n\nA heartwarming story about feelings that grow deep without being noticed.\n\n(Source: Queen2408)",
