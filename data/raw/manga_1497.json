    "synopsis": "Sixteen-year-old Yun Morokawa would not describe herself as a \"lovenista\" or \"love expert.\" Although she falls in love frequently and easily, she can never stay with any guy for long. For Yun, sex causes extreme pain and none of her past boyfriends have been sympathetic regarding her discomfort.\n\nYun has never had reason to interact with juvenile delinquent and gang leader Hiromichi Kondou. But one day, a chance encounter leads to an honest conversation between them. Hiromichi reveals that he secretly aspires to become a make-up artist, and in turn, she divulges her aversion to sex which wars with the constant need to be in a relationship.\n\nHiromichi suggests that Yun would feel pleasure instead of pain with the right sexual partner—and he offers his assistance as a way to help overcome her trauma.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
