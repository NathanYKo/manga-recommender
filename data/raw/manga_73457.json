    "synopsis": "Life isn't going too well for Yuzuki. She is 34 years old and without a boyfriend; the elementary school she works at is close to firing her; and to top it off, she doesn't know what to do with her life at all. But even when she quits her job and tries to have an arranged marriage, things do not work out. Only the bread she eats at the small stationery store around the corner gives her comfort. So one day, she asks the store owner to marry her on a whim and to her surprise, he agrees...?\n\n(Source: MU)",
