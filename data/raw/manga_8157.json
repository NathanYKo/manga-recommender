    "synopsis": "Nanami Momozono is a high school student who has a lot on her plate. Her father had evaded his enormous gambling debts by escaping town, which resulted in his daughter being evicted by the debt collectors. As Nanami muses about her future, she runs into a man hanging onto a tree to escape a dog. She rescues him and tells him about her current situation, prompting the man to offer her his home. He believes that Nanami is more suited than him to be the \"Master\" of the house, and thus she takes him up on his offer.\n\nUpon arrival, however, Nanami discovers that said house is actually a dilapidated shrine. She is about to double back when a fox familiar and two shrine spirits stop her, mistaking her for their former master Mikage, the land god of the shrine. Upon realization, Tomoe—the fox familiar—leaves the shrine, refusing to serve Nanami. After a series of events leaves Nanami in grave danger, she summons Tomoe and seals a contract with him to earn his subservience. Now a human land god, Nanami must face new daunting tasks, menacing adversaries, and her handsome and hot-headed familiar.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
