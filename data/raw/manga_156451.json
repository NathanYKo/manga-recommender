However, her adoptive family will not hesitate to assassinate one another in their fight for control. The new Viola needs to use her wits to convince everyone that she has what it takes while remaining true to her goal. Further complicating her schemes, the male lead looks eerily familiar and has a strange effect on her when she gets too close.\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
