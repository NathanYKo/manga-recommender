    "synopsis": "The winds of fate are blowing through the realm of Midgard. Ragnarok, the prophesized fall of the gods, is at hand, and the age of Man is set to begin. But the ancient gods are not about to resign themselves to fate. They have sent their elite warriors, the Valkyries, to scour the land for those destined to bring about Ragnarok. If the event can be prevented, the reign of the gods will continue for another 1000 years.\n\nFenris Fenrir knows Ragnarok must happen. She is on a desperate search to find the reincarnation of Balder, the fallen god, with whose help she can change the world. But if the Valkyries find him first, Fenris's quest may be over before it even begins.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
