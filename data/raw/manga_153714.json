    "synopsis": "College student Yeo Euijoon has little going for him. To pay his living expenses, tuition, and even his comatose brother's hospital bills, Euijoon spends his nights working at a convenience store. However, it is by no means an ordinary store; it is situated in a dangerous neighborhood, and all sorts of crooks and gangsters tend to come by and stir up trouble. Still, Euijoon never loses his lively spark and greets everyone with a smile.\n\nAlthough most thugs pick fights with Euijoon, one tall, handsome, and well-dressed returning customer makes Euijoon all flustered. Beom Geonwoo is a man of very few words, slightly older than Euijoon, and certainly not a stranger to blood and violence. But Euijoon thinks him sweet, and when Geonwoo by chance catches Euijoon in a sticky personal situation, they start a casual fling that may just turn life-changing for the both of them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
