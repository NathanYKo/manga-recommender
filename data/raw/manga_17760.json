    "synopsis": "Ever since Takashi Murakami started dating Haruhiko Fujimori, the manager of the flower shop he works at, he has been a constant victim of sexual harassment. Although he loves and wants to grow closer to his new boyfriend, Takashi is afraid to take the next step together, intimidated by how direct and brazen Haruhiko is in his advances. However, realizing that he needs to come to terms with the difficulties in their relationship, Takashi decides to let Haruhiko do as he pleases—eventually making love with him for the first time.\n\nThe following morning, Haruhiko proposes the unthinkable: Takashi should move in with him! Initially rejecting the offer, Takashi ultimately gives in and obeys his boss. Now that they are housemates, Takashi must find a way to overcome his fears while dealing with Haruhiko's perverted personality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
