Cassian Lee is a very powerful psyker with a good heart. But one day, when he visits his friend in Greece, things take a wrong turn. Following an unexpected chain of events, Cassian ends up in the body of a Korean high school boy... who has just become a villain! Will his sense of justice win in the end or will he end up becoming a cold-blooded villain?\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
