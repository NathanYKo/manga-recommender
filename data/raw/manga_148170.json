    "synopsis": "Years ago, mysterious portals suddenly appeared, spawning monsters in their wake. At the same time, some people became \"superhumans,\" gifted individuals split into two categories—those who fight the monsters directly as hunters and those who support both hunters and society behind the scenes.\n\nAfter years of training hoping to become a superhuman, Lee Geon Woo gives up and resigns himself to work on a farm to support his family. On one opportune afternoon, he hears a voice coming from a sprouting plant, and he immediately begins raising it. The plant grows up rather quickly, and on the crux of its maturity, it takes the form of a little girl. Adding to his confusion, Geon Woo also receives a notification that the girl is a \"spirit of farming,\" and that he has become a superhuman himself.\n\nAfter gathering himself, Geon Woo names the girl Hawa. With her help, he is able to cultivate crops of unparalleled quality—ones capable of reshaping the world and offering solutions to the hardships faced by those around him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
