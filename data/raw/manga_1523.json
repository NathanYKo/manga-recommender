    "synopsis": "Ichiko's brother Ken is willing to do whatever it takes to become an idol... including turning his sister into a boy to form the male idol group TRIJET! The third member of the group turns out to be Kanzaki, the rising star who tried to kiss Ichiko on the street one day because she was such a cute girl! It's a good thing he doesn't recognize her when she's dressed as a boy, though, because Ichiko musn't tell anyone who she really is for the full year she's agreed to be part of TRIJET. But it's impossible for Ichiko to spend every waking moment as a male, and when she ventures onto the streets as a female, she bumps into Kanzaki again. To keep her identity a secret, she tells him her name is \"Ichigo\" (\"Strawberry\"). Having no idea that she's really TRIJET member \"Ichigou\", whom he detests, or \"Ichiko\", the girl he almost kissed... Kanzaki begins to fall for \"Ichigo\"! \n\n(Source: ShoujoMagic Scanlations)",
