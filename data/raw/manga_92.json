    "synopsis": "\"In the name of the moon, I shall punish you!\"\n\nUsagi Tsukino is a cheerful 14-year-old who attends Juuban Municipal Junior High School. She prefers eating and playing video games to studying, which results in her notably poor grades. She also gets easily upset, whether by baseless insults or reasonable reprimands. It is very unlikely that she could be known as anything but a bad influence and a crybaby, but that begins to change when she meets a black cat.\n\nGiven a special brooch from the black cat named Luna, Usagi can use it to transform into a guardian of justice named Sailor Moon! She is now tasked to protect the Earth from all that is evil and to find both a missing princess and a sacred jewel known as the Mystical Silver Crystal. Whether she likes it or not, Usagi's beautiful transformation marks the start of meeting the mysterious Tuxedo Mask, fighting alongside new comrades, and learning to take responsibility in this acclaimed magical girl classic.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
