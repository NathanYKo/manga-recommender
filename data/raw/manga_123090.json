    "synopsis": "Shy and introverted, Tadokoro passes her free time in class drawing instead of hanging out with her classmates. But even when her classmates approach her, it's only to make fun of her drawings and appearance. In stark contrast, Nikaido is well-liked among her peers as she has both beauty and smarts. And while everyone makes fun of Tadokoro, Nikaido on the other hand, is totally infatuated with her. Just one look at one of Tadokoro's drawings and Nikaido fell in love with the art and eventually, the artist herself. When Tadokoro offers to draw Nikaido a portrait, Nikaido becomes ecstatic as this maybe her chance to get closer with the girl she has been obsessing over!\n\n(Source: LILYKA)",
