    "synopsis": "The comedy manga follows a male part-time late-night convenience store worker named Matsukoma, and the new part-time worker he trains named Tomoharu Nii, nicknamed Nietzsche-sensei. Tomoharu is a university student in the school's Buddhism department. When an angry customer screams at Tomoharu, \"Customers are gods!,\" he replies, \"God is dead.\" The manga follows the part-time worker life of Matsukoma and Tomoharu, the latter of whom continuously baffles his customers and co-workers at the convenience store with his odd ways.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
