    "synopsis": "Gathering every ounce of courage he has, Makoto Koga, an introverted third-year high school student, decides to confess to his crush Saki Meguro—a popular second-year student considered the most beautiful girl at their school. Surprisingly, Saki accepts his confession, marking the start of Makoto's first relationship. However, he also did not expect Saki to admit that she is not a virgin, having dated before Makoto.\n\nDespite the huge difference in their relationship experiences, Saki has had only a few romantic interactions. As a result of her previous boyfriends' conduct, she immediately anticipates Makoto to ask her for sexual favors. Nevertheless, Makoto's shy yet kind heart exposes Saki to new tender memories, ushering the couple into a genuine, heartwarming romance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
