    "synopsis": "The world is on the verge of collapse as bizarre monsters called Vertexes fall from the heavens wreaking havoc. Sent by the heavenly gods, these creatures seek humanity's destruction and ravage the land in the effort to do so. However, the Shikoku and Nagano regions miraculously persist amid all the attacks.\n\nIn response to the invasion, girls with high aptitude known as Heroes soon awaken and are granted divine powers by the earthly gods. Assisted by shrine maidens who can hear the voices of gods, Heroes are the only beings able to fight back against the Vertexes. Among the chosen protectors is the strong-willed Wakaba Nogi, who is driven by her steadfast desire to avenge the countless innocent lives lost.\n\nWith her natural charisma, Wakaba leads the first-generation Hero Team in the Shikoku region. Defending what remains of mankind, Wakaba and her friends brave the battle with the Vertexes head-on—testing the bonds between them as they overcome the many challenges in this cruel reality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
