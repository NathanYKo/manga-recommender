    "synopsis": "Akira Togawa is a normal teenager: he goes to an average high school, he plays video games, he's in love with his step-brother, he's harassed by lecherous photographers, picked on by mischievous little boys, insulted by possessive young women...you get the idea. When a scruffy photographer by the name of Kaoru Nakahara has a premonition of love (or so he says) and takes a campus photography job, he ends up meeting Akira and falls head over heels. Will Akira learn to love the persistent pervert, or will he cling to his beloved brother?\n\n(Source: Juné Manga)",
