Himura passed away on June 17, 2015 after more than two years of fighting cancer, leaving this and another series she started while being in the hospital—Nyuuin Note (Hospitalization Notebook)—in an unfinished state. The last volume containing chapters 15 to 20 was published only in digital format on September 24.",
