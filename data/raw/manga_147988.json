    "synopsis": "Mercedia Sasha has it all: looks, wealth, status... No man is good enough for her, and she makes sure everyone knows the fact. Her single life is peaceful and perfect... until one day, she wakes up wearing a hideous wedding dress aboard a ship in the middle of the ocean! To her horror, someone has devised an elaborate kidnapping to wed her off to admiral Demetriu Cyprosa, the empire's greatest war hero—or massive jerk, as others call him behind his back. What's worse, they're headed to a deserted island for their honeymoon! Can the incompatible newlyweds put aside their quarrels to plan an escape? Or will their stubborn ways get the best of them before they can exact revenge on the ones who set them up?\n\n(Source: Tappytoon)",
