    "synopsis": "Kurumi Yoshizawa is the student council president, with excellent grades and good manners... but in reality, she is spending her days struggling with the constraints of her mother and the excessive expectations of her teachers. One day, Yoshizawa is asked by her homeroom teacher to look after her absentee classmate Naoi, but Naoi could only look down on Yoshizawa as if she had been able to see through her heart. On the verge of breaking down from stress, Yoshizawa just barely suppresses the sudden urge to shoplift, but Naoi records the whole thing...\n\nThis is a violent coming-of-age story about two people struggling in everyday life with no escape.\n\n(Source: Ichijinsha, translated)",
