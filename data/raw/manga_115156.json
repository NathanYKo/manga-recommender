    "synopsis": "Having been forced to lead a life full of deception, corporate employee Youji Amezaki has become completely fed up with his work. However, things take a sudden turn when he finds himself transported to a magical world, where humans are considered the strongest beings and even worshipped as gods by many. Despite the dwindling existence of humans in the realm, the populace continues to search for human relics and their immense power, making Youji's appearance a drastic surprise.\n\nAfter being rescued by Youji and witnessing his remarkable strength, an elf girl named Ria wishes to help him conceal his identity. With the assistance of his newfound companion, Youji embarks on a quest to shelter himself from potential enemies—although the arrival of new, eccentric allies and Ria herself may prove to be distracting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
