    "synopsis": "Yuuri Hasegawa is a laid-back teenager attending an average school. In contrast, Keiichirou \"Keiichi\" Katsuragi comes from an important family of politicians, bearing their expectations for him to lead the country in the future. And yet, despite their differences, Yuuri and Keiichi are in love with each other.\n\nUpon dating, Yuuri is astounded by Keiichi's seemingly endless list of traditions that he is required to uphold. He cannot engage in any degree of intimacy, and he is constantly tailed by an armada of bodyguards who report his every movement to his family. All Yuuri wants is a normal relationship, but every attempt she makes to breach her boyfriend's unyielding composure goes up in flames.\n\nWhile he might not show it explicitly, even Keiichi longs to be able to touch Yuuri. He looks for loopholes in his family's rules—anything to improve the situation of his romance. Keeping their hands to themselves, Yuuri and Keiichi are forced to go against all odds to make their relationship last.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
