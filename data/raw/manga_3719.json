So despite the facts that she is a cry baby, a coward, has a baby face, and only has an A cupâ€”she is much more passionate about pursuing her goals than others. One day her teacher, Abe-sensei, tells her she is not fit to be a doctor. From then on, a battle between them begins. There's an added twist! Abe-sensei and Shin are neighbors! Now, her journey to becoming a doctor will be even more difficult than imagined!",
