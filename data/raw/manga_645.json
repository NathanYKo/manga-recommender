    "synopsis": "What happens when an all-girls' high school reigning tomboy finds out her school is about to be filled with boys!?\n\nHanabi Oozora is a rambunctious 16-year-old tomboy who comes to the rescue of her less assertive friends—sometimes in exchange for food. So what does she do when, all of a sudden, her all-girls' school is about to be integrated with an all-boys' school?!\n\nShe meets and falls in love—naturally—with one of the three most popular and handsome boys in the Student Council, Yasuaki Garaku! Unfortunately, Yasuaki doesn't care for girls...and when the girls' Student Council clashes head-on with the boys' Student Council, Hanabi steps in to become a member—hoping she'll change Yasuaki's mind!\n\n(Source: VIZ)",
