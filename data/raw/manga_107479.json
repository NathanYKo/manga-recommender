    "synopsis": "Hamanishi FC is your average elementary school soccer team—or is it? While the team's record isn't impressive, it seems to have a bunch of diamonds in the rough. Soushi is super fast, Roku is a great leader, and the newest addition and only girl, Akira, seems to be great at all aspects of the sport. After Akira demonstrates her skills on the field, the team seems to accept her, even the stubborn Soushi. But boys will be boys...\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nAlso includes Kogane-iro series.",
