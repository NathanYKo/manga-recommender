    "synopsis": "The year is 2301, one hundred fifty years since terraforming operations began on the planet Aqua—formerly known as Mars—causing it to be almost entirely covered with water. Aqua's capital, Neo-Venezia, is a near-perfect copy of the wonderful, dreamy city of Venice back on Manhome—previously known as Earth. Citizens and tourists alike take their time exploring the city and admiring its rustic charm, especially by riding one of the many gondolas gliding along the waterways.\n\nHighly skilled and knowledgeable women known as Undines navigate the gondolas and act as tour guides of Neo-Venezia. Originating from Manhome, several well-renowned Undine companies have made their home in the capital, with many young girls aspiring to join their ranks.\n\nChasing her dream of becoming an Undine, Manhome native Akari Mizunashi begins her training as an apprentice at the Aria Company. Soon after arriving in town, she becomes acquainted with her mentor Alicia Florence, a pudgy cat named Aria Pokoteng, and Aika S. Granzchesta, a fellow Undine apprentice from the Himeya Company. Together with her new friends, Akari strives to become a full-fledged Undine while taking in all the magical sights and sounds that Neo-Venezia generously offers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Othello Game (Ebony &amp; Ivory)",
