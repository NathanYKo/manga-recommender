    "synopsis": "Three years ago, Ichika Sendawara learned that she only had two years left to live. Now, in her second year of university, Ichika realizes that she has outlived her purpose, but she still hangs on, despite the unpredictability of her fatal illness. On a day as mundane as any other, Ichika reunites with the man who turned her world around—the source of her hope and happiness—her former professor.\n\nAkifumi Yurugi, a quiet and reserved man, resigned from teaching and now ponders about the shambles he once called a life. Bearing the cold truth, he skeptically wonders if there is any hope left for him.\n\nAs Ichika finds a new purpose, she can only hope for her unwavering love to be reciprocated—before she or Akifumi disappears, and their fates catch up with them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
