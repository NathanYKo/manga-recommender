    "synopsis": "Kaoru Kamisawa can see—and cut—not just the red thread of fate, but any of the many threads which bind people to each other in varying forms. He uses this ability to run a business where he gets rid of pesky relationships for others. Ironically, Kamisawa himself has no red thread, and therefore is forever fated to watch his lovers find their destined one and leave him behind.\n\nHe thought he had long since come to terms with this harsh reality, until the day when a man named Hara comes to him for help getting rid of a stalker...\n\n(Source: MU)",
