He knows he's a catch, but right now he's more interested in catching a brazen, blond brat and teaching him a lesson or two. Looks like every girl's dream man has some growing pains to go through.\n\nBold and edgy—the first boys' love story from Korea that is sure to entice the senses.\n\n(Source: DramaQueen)",
