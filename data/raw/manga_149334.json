    "synopsis": "Masachika Kuze, an unmotivated first-year student attending the prestigious Seirei Academy, mostly spends his time playing gacha games or dozing off during lectures. Despite his reputation as an undisciplined loafer, he attracts the interest of Alisa Mikhailovna \"Alya\" Kujou, the esteemed \"solitary princess\" who sits next to him in class.\n\nAlya is deeply revered by her peers, and she captivates people everywhere she goes thanks to her entrancing looks and impeccable conduct. However, the beautiful half-Russian, half-Japanese girl has an adorable secret: while she constantly berates Masachika for his lax behavior, she conceals her true feelings with affectionate and flirtatious remarks in Russian.\n\nUnbeknownst to Alya, Masachika picks up every single one of her comments—for he is fluent in Russian! Bewildered by her enigmatic actions, Masachika decides to act clueless and play along, sparking an unconventional and heartwarming relationship with the charming girl.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
