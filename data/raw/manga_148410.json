    "synopsis": "Be it throwing herself off her balcony, drinking poison, or even stabbing herself, Eris Miserian has attempted every means to end her miserable existence and return to her real home in South Korea. But—trapped within the confines of a novel she only skimmed through—Eris is denied death until she fulfills her purpose as a minor character, a mad villainess. There is not a single upside to her situation, as only people who eagerly anticipate her humiliation and suffering surround her.\n\nInstead of trying to change the course of the novel, Eris wholeheartedly embraces the role of a villainess. She wishes to perish and avoid reincarnation in this realm, hastening her return to her own reality. That is why she must let the novel's plot unfold and ultimately die by execution. In the meantime, she leverages her high social status to manipulate other characters and seek out those who can ensure her soul will be sent back to Korea. Even in the face of insurmountable plot restrictions, Eris intends to break every law to finally escape this wretched world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
