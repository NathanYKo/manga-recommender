    "synopsis": "After a powerful dragon attacked her country, Princess Arsinoe Grancamano of the Kingdom of Helentar was forced to create a pact with Sent Fauna, a powerful deity of Paradise, to drive it away. In order to do so, Arsinoe sacrificed one of her most precious memories and subsequently fell into a coma.\n\nA month later, she wakes to find herself hidden away from the world in the care of a nearby village and discovers that her mother died in the attack on Helentar. While she is overcome with grief, Arsinoe meets King Cervin, a mysterious man claiming to be her father. However, Arsinoe has no recollection of him ever being involved in her life—as her memories of her father are what she offered to Sent Fauna.\n\nDespite their uncertain past, the pair decide to travel together and endeavor to achieve Asinoe's goal: to exact revenge on Contrano, the one who summoned the dragon that killed her mother and destroyed her kingdom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
