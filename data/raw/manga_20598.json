    "synopsis": "Defiant and vulgar, Princess Kaguya Takenouchi is not the heir to the moon's Silver Court that her mother's retainers had hoped for. But when the empress falls ill during a wave of terrorist attacks, Kaguya resolves to do right by her people and rise to the occasion.\n\nUnfortunately, Kaguya's enemies are a step ahead of her, and she ends up ejected from the moon and stranded on the primitive Tainted World below. Can she find her way back to the moon and reclaim the throne that is rightfully hers from the usurpers?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
