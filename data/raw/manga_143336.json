    "synopsis": "Inside a spaceship, a group of five crewmates—Tamago, King, Megane, Yankee, and Cap—has gathered to play a game of Among Us. They all have victory in mind, but only one person plans to win at the others' expense: the impostor, Tamago. With Tamago aiming to eliminate everyone but himself, the other crewmates must suss him out as quickly as possible. However, their absurd deductive skills prove ineffective in spotting the suspect amid the crew, as they poorly attempt to identify the impostor among them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
