    "synopsis": "Miza Yuuji is the so-called \"beautiful priest\" of Uguisuzaka Shopping District, loved and respected by all not only for his skills as a Buddhist priest but for his demure demeanor and kind air. While he professes to have pledged himself to the cloth, vowing to remain unmarried and celibate for life... he's harbored a crush on his best friend Saburou since middle school. Now that Saburou's back in town, taking over his parents' tofu shop after an eight-year absence, Yuuji must deal with feelings he thought he'd long since moved past—and that's when he gets drunk one evening in Saburou's presence.\n\n(Source: September Scanlations)",
