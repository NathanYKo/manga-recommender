    "synopsis": "20-year-old university student, Sara Moritani, rushes back to the countryside to help her grandfather with his farm after he's been injured. There, she meets a veteran strawberry farmer named Minori Sugiura, who is 13 years older than she is. He teaches Sara the ropes of strawberry farming. At first, she was frightened by Minori's intimidating demeanor. But after discovering many surprising sides to him, she could feel love taking roots within her heart. On the other side of the relationship, Minori finds himself attracted to Sara. But due to their age difference, he finds it difficult to express his feelings to her... Thus begins a pure and touching love story between these two awkward lovebirds.\n\n(Source: Square Enix)",
