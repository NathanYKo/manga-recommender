    "synopsis": "She always lived by the rules. She thought her life had been honorable. She was loyal to the emperor, even at the cost of her life. But the only thing she got in return was the blade of the guillotine.\n\n\"Why? Why is it like this?\" she kept asking before her death. However, when she opened her eyes, she had returned to five years before she died. \"Was the way I lived wrong?\" she kept thinking.\n\nSigrid decided to change her way of life: what to eat, what to wear, what to buy, everything. The way she changed led her to be the center of everything. Although, everything eventually started to go back to the way it was. And so, Sigrid came face-to-face with her old rival and enemy, Veramud.\n\n\"It begins by making friends.\"\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",
