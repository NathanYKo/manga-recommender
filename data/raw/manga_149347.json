    "synopsis": "During her decade-long engagement to Crown Prince Kaizen Rastiel, Astelle von Lestern spared no effort to learn how to become a good empress. But on their wedding night, the old emperor dies, and Kaizen requests an immediate divorce, as their marriage was only his father's wish. Retaining her dignity, Astelle never admits her love and even renounces her power-hungry family as the shameful one-day empress.\n\nHowever, Astelle soon realizes she is pregnant. As Kaizen ascends the throne, he abolishes the old aristocracy, and Astelle's greedy father becomes his biggest opponent. If Astelle were to return with her son, Theore, he would just be used as a pawn on both sides of the growing political conflict. To protect Theore's identity and childhood, Astelle takes him into hiding for six years. But in a twist, she is forced to stand before the emperor once again, triggering a dangerous political game to ensure that Kaizen never discovers who Theore truly is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
