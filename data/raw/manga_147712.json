    "synopsis": "Han Jia, a 32-year-old freelancer currently without a job, is fed up with her current situation, being constantly harassed by her parents over getting married and moving out. One day, an agitated Jia stumbles upon her childhood friend Jin Mincheol, who is in a similar predicament. While catching up with each other, Jia abruptly blurts out that she and Mincheol should get married! To her surprise, he accepts her proposal, and the two start living as a married couple.\n\nHowever, since Jia and Mincheol are both eccentric in their own ways, the newlyweds often disagree, learning new things about each other in the process. As their relationship deepens, the awkwardness begins to fade away, and the couple starts to see that they are maybe meant to be for each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
