    "synopsis": "Sung-Gi Jang is cursed with the persona of a complete pervert! To all his peers, he is a fiend who only hungers for women. Yet in reality, he just has terrible social skills, making him incapable of properly expressing his intentions and feelings to the women around him. On top of that, he seems to have the worst luck there can be.\n\nThis all turns around when Jae Hwang, a fellow student and good friend, witnesses Sung-Gi completely shattered and decides to help him out. What Sung does not know is that Hwang is actually a master in attracting the opposite sex—a pick-up artist!\n\nFrom square one, Sung-Gi builds up his conversation and interaction skills with women through several trials and tribulations. He soon learns how much depth and finesse there is in properly conveying intimate emotions to others. As he learns about the subconscious signals sent out by people, Sung-Gi finds himself paying more and more attention to a particular girl in his class, and he puts to use the skill that he was lacking before: The Skill of Lure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
