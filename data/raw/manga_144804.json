    "synopsis": "Aoi Harukawa, Tomoya Sugisaki, and Ryou Kobayashi are three teenagers brought together by the prospect of meeting the Summer Ghost. The urban legend states that the spirit of a black-clad young woman with long hair will appear in an abandoned airfield when fireworks are lit.\n\nDuring their search, the three are bearing the weight of the world on their shoulders. Relentlessly bullied at school, Aoi does not see a point in continuing to live. Tomoya is forbidden from having a creative outlet for his stress due to fears that it will affect his grades. Ryou quits his basketball team despite still feeling passion for the sport.\n\nEach teen has their own reason for wanting to meet the spirit who died by suicide, but it seems as if something else draws Aoi, Tomoya, and Ryou together. As their summer comes to an end, the trio begins to wonder if the ghost will be able to provide answers to their lingering, morbid questions about death.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
