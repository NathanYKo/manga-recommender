    "synopsis": "A legendary monster appears close to a village. To prevent it from attacking, the villagers offer it the town's only virgin, Pepopa, as a sacrifice to save the village. The monster eats her, but she was spit out the second after, because she tastes disgusting and had super stinky feet among other things...\n\nPepopa somehow got to live only to be sent back to the monster again after the villagers tried to \"fix her taste.\" Now more healthy than ever she went back to the monster...\n\n(Source: MU, edited)",
