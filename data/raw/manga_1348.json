    "synopsis": "It's the Century of Darkness where monsters known as Vandels rule the world, and the Vandel Busters are the only ones who can fight them. When a group of Busters are killed in battle, they pass on their magic Saiga weapons to Beet, making him the strongest Buster ever. But Beet won't just fight the Vandels—he wants to destroy them and finally end the Century of Darkness.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
    "background": "On October 6, 2006, Boukenou Beet was put on hiatus due to Koji Inada's illness. Furthermore, with the discontinuation of Shounen Jump (Monthly) on June 6, 2007, it was put on an indefinite hiatus instead. On December 21, 2015, in the combined third and fourth issue of Weekly Shounen Jump, it was announced that the series would resume serialization in the Spring issue of Jump SQ.Crown, which was published on April 16, 2016. Boukenou Beet has been published in English as Beet the Vandel Buster by VIZ Media under the Shonen Jump imprint since October 19, 2004.",
