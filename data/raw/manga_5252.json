    "synopsis": "Reo-chan, a first year girl, gets dumped by her boyfriend because she's not skilled in the home economic traits women should possess in his mind. Her ex tells her that she must apply to a \"housework\" club before he reconsiders going out with her. Therefore Reo-chan has little choice but to join. But here's the catch: the only members are four gorgeous bishies. The other first year in the club, Irinaka, competes with her a lot. As the story progresses Reo and Irinaka get forced into a lot of interesting situations together and in the meantime become closer and closer.",
