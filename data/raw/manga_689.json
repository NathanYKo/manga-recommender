    "synopsis": "Despite his kind-hearted and sensitive nature, Ian Hasumi is called \"Ian the Liar\" for one reason: he can see things that nobody else can. This includes fairies and \"Tokage,\" a malicious doppelganger with lizard-colored green hair. When Ian reunites with Rin Ishinagi, his childhood friend and the one person who once believed him, news of \"fairy murders\" spreads around the city.\n\nVictims of these murders are easily identified by the wing-like bloodstains on their backs. Ian stumbles upon a murder where he encounters Kaito, a mysterious man who also discovers the crime scene. Kaito is the owner of an odd shop that sells crystal cubes with insects frozen inside. Insisting that Ian did not see anything, Kaito gifts him a crystal cube with a lizard inside before bidding him farewell. \n\nUnfortunately for Ian, Tokage utilizes the cube in an attempt to take over his body and leave Ian as a spirit, destined to perish. Determined to change his fate, Ian makes a contract with none other than Kaito and his stingy fairy companion—all while hoping to reunite with Rin again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Psycho Knocker",
