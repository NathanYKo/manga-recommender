    "synopsis": "At a glance, Minoru Suzuki appears to be a first-year high school student like any other. However, Minoru sometimes receives flashbacks that seem to derive from his dead father's memory; to complicate things further, these memories feature his mother, Aya Suzuki, from his father's perspective when the two were young and still in school.\n\nThese flashbacks have caused Minoru to experience incredibly conflicting feelings, especially an undeniable attraction to Aya's body. He cannot easily decipher his emotions, nor does he understand what his father wants him to do with these memories—the only thing Minoru knows for sure is that he loves his mother.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Lucky Spider",
