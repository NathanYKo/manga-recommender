    "synopsis": "The bullied girl in class Rin Sakura and the honor student who doesn't want to make any waves, Yuuya Komine, were classmates and haven't once exchanged words with each other. Everything between them changes when Yuuya goes with the flow around him and tells her to go die. Rin jumps from the classroom window. She escapes death and claims that it was Yuuya's fault. The bewildered Yuuya tells Rin that he'll do anything as he begs for forgiveness. Rin tells him that what she wishes for is love.\n\n(Source: MU)",
