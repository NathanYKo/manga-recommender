    "synopsis": "Haru and Hii-chan are two young women in college buckling under the weight of adult responsibilities. Getting into university, then job hunting, then preparing for careers after graduation–it's what they're expected to do, because that's what \"everyone\" does, but what do they really want for themselves? Finally, Haru and Hii-chan decide to take life into their own hands, toss their resumes into the sea, and move to an island together! They soon find that island living isn't all blue skies and breezing through sunny days...but whatever the future holds, they can face it together.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
