    "synopsis": "Fed up of being called a \"clumsy good-for-nothing\" by her classmates, Hana Aoi resolves to change by answering a job advertisement for part-time work at a local zoo. Despite its gaudy design and lack of visitors, the derelict zoo is a paradise to Hana who cannot wait to spend her evenings looking after cute animals. That is, until she bumps into a giant, anthropomorphic rabbit!\n\nHana soon discovers that the rabbit is actually the zoo director, Shiina, a human cursed by a ghost with the strange ability to transform normal animals into humanoids. In order to get his original body back, Shiina must prove his love of animals by making his zoo the best in the world. But, with a principle to only do fun things, caring for animals is too much of a bore. This is where Hana comes in.\n\nLocked into employment—and secrecy—by the egotistical rabbit, Hana realizes that if she is to have any hope of changing herself, she must first survive a world in which the line between man and beast can no longer be distinguished.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 4: Oumagadoki Doubutsuen (pilot)\nVolume 5: Boku no Hero",
