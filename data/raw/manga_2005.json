    "synopsis": "Izaki always did well in life, no matter it was school or tennis. Nothing was handed to him; all was gained through effort and diligence. Because of his straightforward nature, he tended to clash with others. That was the way he knew and he extended his belief not only to himself but also the people around him. He was satisfied with his modest achievements, that is until he met the true genius, Hakamada...\n\nHakamada, the quiet prodigy insomuch as things just come easily to him. He doesn't have to work or study hard, and manages to come out on top which is frustrating for Izaki who realizes he'll never reach that level no matter how hard he tries.\n\nAt the school reunion after 8 years, Izaki finds himself drinking like old friends with his self proclaimed rival. Before he can even make sense of the strange situation, he found himself in a strange bed...\n\n(Source: MU)",
