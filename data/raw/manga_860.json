Horrified after stumbling upon an adult film, she’s convinced that all men are devils -- and it's hard to overcome her fear when her father is the worst one of all! Thanks to him, Rion is thrown together with three different guys and forced to choose one as a fiancé! Suddenly faced with three impatient grooms, can Rion overcome her fear long enough to unveil her father's hidden agenda -- and get out of her impending wedding?\n\n(Source: Go Comi)",
