    "synopsis": "From the creator of Full Moon wo Sagashite comes a story set in the 30th century, when the whole world is ruled under one kingdom named Earth. Princess Kyouko is about to turn 16 years old, and a large celebration will be held throughout the country. Unknown to the people, the princess has secretly been living among them as Kyouko Suomi, a headstrong and selfish junior high student. Kyouko has never appeared at any of the kingdom's past ceremonies, and doesn't plan to attend this ceremony either, for doing so will end her youthful school life.\n\nHowever, her father, the king of Earth, offers her another option—Kyouko must find the 12 telepaths who can use the God Stones in order to wake up her twin sister, Princess Ui, who has been asleep since her birth. If Kyouko succeeds, the king will allow her to live however she likes, and will pass on her duties to her sister. Accepting this offer, Kyouko is given the first of the God Stones, the Time-Space Stone, and will need to find the remaining God Stones and their users, with the help of her two bodyguards Sakataki and Hizuki Jin.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
