    "synopsis": "Takahiro Abe, a regular high school boy, has a crush on Rumi Asai, who happens to be a hardcore, yaoi-loving, otaku-ish fujoshi. Her biggest fantasy is Abe and Shunsuke Chiba, the handsome class playboy, having homosexual affairs. To make things more complicated, Youko Matsui, class babe, accidentally reveals herself as an otaku-in-closet, and befriends Asai sharing fellow otaku interests. Every time Abe tries to convey his sincere feelings to Asai, something always gets in the way, be it his crazy friends or Asai's misunderstandings. How will he be able to confess to this bizarre girl!?\n\n(Source: ANN)",
