    "synopsis": "Hina Arukado is a modern vampire who drinks blood from bags instead of humans. But she's also a complete shut-in who hasn't left the house in 30 years. In an effort to reach her, Hina's worried dad does something that changes her life—he gives her the complete box set of the Vampire Cross anime series! Hina is instantly obsessed with everything about the show, especially the character Mao. But it's hard to fan as hard as she wants from her bedroom in Romania, so now Hina is out of the house and off to Japan to live her otaku dream!\n\nJapan is otaku heaven for Hina, and she's so busy collecting as much merch as her new apartment can hold that she almost doesn't feel bad about missing out on the special menus at Vampire Cross cafes. If only she had a human friend who could eat all the themed food for her! But connecting with humans isn't easy until Hina literally bumps into her neighbor Kyuta, a prickly boy who looks just like Mao. Having her best friend live next door will be so convenient! If she can just convince him to actually be friends...\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
