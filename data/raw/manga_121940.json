    "synopsis": "Atsurou Aoki comes from a family of hardworking academics, but he never had the same ambition as them. Now a high school teacher, Aoki displays little interest in his work and his students, sitting idly as the days pass by. However, when one of his students, Kasai, stops showing up to class, it becomes Aoki's issue to fix. To find the reason behind Kasai's behavior, Aoki visits the nurse's office, where Kasai has been known to spend his time. But the controversial school nurse, Manabu Tengoku, is already expecting Aoki.\n\nTengoku's ability to read Aoki's every thought on his face is chilling. With just one look, the nurse makes Aoki feel naked and exposed, yet his body embarrassingly reacts to Tengoku's unconventional desire to discover what excites every person. Although Aoki tries to reject his advances, he knows that something deeper and more lascivious keeps tempting him back to Tengoku's infirmary, where pain and pleasure are one and the same.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
