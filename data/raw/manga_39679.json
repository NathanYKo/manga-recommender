    "synopsis": "Ruri Tanaka has had enough of watching the boy she likes, Rito Fuwa, waste his days playing gal games—a type of dating simulation with attractive girls. Desperate to make Fuwa notice her, Ruri organizes a group date at a maid cafe to gather intel on any feelings Fuwa could have for her.\n\nWhen Fuwa enters the cafe, a beautiful yet endearingly clumsy maid named Fuwari seems to recognize him. Although she respectfully refers to him as \"Master,\" Fuwari cannot turn her attention away from Fuwa. Once he is left alone, she makes the most unexpected request: to date her for a month.\n\nHaving been hurt in the past, Fuwa is reluctant to open his heart. But he ultimately accepts Fuwari's deal, and the two partner up to conquer love, much to Ruri's displeasure. However, their agreement comes with one more condition: if their outlook on romance changes in the next 30 days, they will tell each other their true names—and Fuwari's real identity may explain the secret behind her unconventional proposal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
