    "synopsis": "The young man's new apartment is haunted, but as it turns out, even the dead have their own personal shortcomings... issues of the flesh included. For the dead have lingering desires, and are more susceptible to the world of the living than what one may think. There's anger, there's hate, there's curiosity... and there's love too. Here he finds a ghastly girl who observes him quietly, certainly desiring something... No wonder the rent is cheap!\n\n(Source: MU)",
