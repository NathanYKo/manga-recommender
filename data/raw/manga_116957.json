    "synopsis": "There is not a lot that can faze Naoto Misono, a sincere and solemn office worker. One of the rarer exceptions is Shizuka Hoshino, his senior coworker who also happens to be a witch. Hoshino goes out of her way to help Misono, always flying to the scene on her broom to save the day. In contrast to Misono, who is always calm and composed, Hoshino is easily flustered and often scrambles to find the right words to express herself. However, the way Hoshino wears her heart on her sleeve causes Misono's own heart to skip a beat.\n\nBefore he knows it, Misono finds himself vying for Hoshino's attention; however, things are seldom as easy as they seem. He must be prepared to brave it all—even protective brothers and jealous ex-boyfriends—to ensure that his feelings reach Hoshino.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
