    "synopsis": "Mio loves radio, where she can be herself in private while still sharing her interests with the world—totally unlike her twin brother, Yuuta, the popular extrovert on the volleyball team. But when the love of Yuuta's life decides to study abroad in Australia, he asks Mio to do the unthinkable—go to school in his place! Suddenly Mio is thrust not only into the world of volleyball, but of men's dorms...and must do whatever she can to keep her secret!\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",
