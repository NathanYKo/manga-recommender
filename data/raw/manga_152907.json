    "synopsis": "Art student Hibari Akanishi struggles to find free time between her part-time job and school. Her schedule becomes even more hectic with her upcoming project: she must make a trendy fashion design to display in front of countless people. However, all her creations end up being stale. While continuing her project at work, her laptop is accidentally soaked and broken by a customer—a flashy guy making a scene. Furious that her hard work is gone, Hibari lashes out at him before she storms out.\n\nAt the end of her shift, the rude client takes Hibari to his apartment to apologize. The eccentric boy introduces himself as Gaku Sausei, a member of a rock band and fellow art student. He lends her his computer so she can finish her assignment by the deadline. Despite Gaku's free-spirited personality clashing with Hibari's serious nature, his blunt remarks encourage Hibari to experiment with her design in ways she would not have dared to attempt before. As Hibari gets closer to Gaku, her ordinary world is about to be flipped upside down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
