    "synopsis": "When the xenoterran invasion began, the only ones who stood between us and the monstrous creatures were the superhumans. But while some chose to use this power for good, others had more sinister intentions. Kang Lim is a high school student with a secret—he's the vigilante superhero known as the White Cap, fighting back the mysterious monsters whenever he can. But the world he protects isn't what it seems—there is more to the emergence of the xenoterran than meets the eye, and strange forces are at play in the shadows...\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
