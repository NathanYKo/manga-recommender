    "synopsis": "Tooru Miyama has become one of the most popular hosts in Kabukichou under the alias \"Mizuki.\" The secret to his success? He can read a person's mind by looking into their eyes, which allows him to be perceptive of his customers' needs. But that is not the only thing he is hiding: he is also a fan of Mizuki Hikawa, a male model who has recently been gaining the public's attention.\n\nWhile buying a magazine featuring Mizuki, Tooru bumps into the man himself in need of a ride. Excited that his idol is within his reach, Tooru helps him out and quickly befriends him. Furthermore, when he hears his thoughts, Tooru realizes that Mizuki is interested in him as well. However, Tooru soon discovers that behind his angelic facade, Mizuki is a sadist who desires to control him and make him cry.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
