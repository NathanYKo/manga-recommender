    "synopsis": "Nobody understands why the brilliant six-year-old Inés Valeztena de Perez picked Cárcel Escalante de Esposa as her fiancé. Considering her family's high status, she could have easily married the crown prince and led an outstanding life as the empress. Cárcel grew up believing that Inés loved him deeply, despite her eerily emotionless demeanor and understated style. But, put in a difficult position against his will, he harbored no affection for such a dull person and instead turned to countless other women behind her back.\n\nCárcel's whole reality crumbles when Inés catches him in the act—because she does not care whatsoever. She intends to turn a blind eye to his infidelity even after tying the knot, which leaves Cárcel in complete disbelief. Inés' indifference ignites a perverse desire inside Cárcel, and he abruptly loses interest in everyone else. However, there is a reason behind each of Inés' actions, and it all started when she took her own life for the very first time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
