    "synopsis": "The heir of the huge Fushiki corporation, Tomoe, comes to Japan as an exchange student. He is his father's youngest child and on top of that, his mistress's child, but he was still appointed as heir. There's danger that people will aim for his life. They attach to him a new maid, with glasses, naturally clumsy and ill-mannered... who turns out to be his new bodyguard, defending Tomoe with her mop!\n\n(Source: Aerandria Scans)",
