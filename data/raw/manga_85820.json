    "synopsis": "Tired of being harassed both inside and outside the classroom, Makoto Nanase decides to commit suicide by jumping off his school. However, much to his surprise, he is sent back to the roof from where he jumped, and a strange woman tells him he has died and is in purgatory.\n\nTo escape, Makoto has to help the people around him face their own personal problems. Though invisible to others and able to walk through walls, Makoto discovers that he is still able to manipulate objects if his will is strong enough.\n\nMakoto is now forced to embark on a mission to save the same people he tried to leave behind and face the unexpected ways his death affected each of them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
