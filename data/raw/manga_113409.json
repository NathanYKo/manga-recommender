    "synopsis": "Tsugu Miikura and her family have recently moved back to Tsugu's hometown. After spending six years away due to family circumstances, Tsugu is excited to be reunited with her childhood friends—Yuushin, Asari, and Sora—in high school. On the surface, Tsugu believes that nothing has changed since they last saw each other; however, what she fails to see are the cracks that formed in their friendship after they wrote and buried their wishes in the park back then.\n\nAsari's jealousy of Tsugu's popularity at school causes her to start harassing Tsugu, while Yuushin has begun mercilessly bullying Sora in an attempt to deal with the frustrations of his personal life. After witnessing Sora attempt to take his own life, Tsugu saves him and proposes that they run away from home. Believing that his failure to support Yuushin during their childhood is the reason his friend drastically changed, Sora accepts her invitation and promises to become stronger in the future. With nothing more than some money, the clothes on their backs, and Tsugu's now-broken Fender Stratocaster in tow, the two make their way to Tokyo at the break of dawn. Leaving the world they used to know behind them, the two teenagers embark on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nIn the absence of their friends, Yuushin and Asari are similarly forced to confront their inner demons and uncover new sides to themselves. However, the most surprising realization might be that they have not really changed after all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: Love Letter",
