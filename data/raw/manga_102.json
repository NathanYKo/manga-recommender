    "synopsis": "Tooru Honda is an orphan with nowhere to go but a tent in the woods, until the Souma family takes her in. However, the Souma family is no ordinary family, and they hide a grave secret: when they are hugged by someone of the opposite gender, they turn into animals from the Chinese zodiac!\n\nNow, Tooru must help Kyou and Yuki Souma hide their curse from their classmates, as well as her friends Arisa Uotani and Saki Hanajima. As she is drawn further into the mysterious world of the Soumas, she meets more of the family, forging friendships along the way.\n\nBut this curse has caused much suffering; it has broken many Soumas. Despite this, Tooru may just be able to heal their hearts and soothe their souls.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Fruits Basket won the 25th Kodansha Manga Award in the Shoujo category in 2001. The series was published in English by Tokyopop from February 10, 2004, to July 6, 2009. The publisher later released a box set with the complete series and ultimate edition omnibus volumes that include new cover art. These releases were met with mixed reviews, as they were exact reproductions of the previously released volumes and did not adjust page numbers or correct prior errors. Yen Press republished the series in 12 omnibus volumes from June 28, 2016, to April 18, 2017. It was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora JBC from April 2005 to July 2007.",
