    "synopsis": "Bartender Yoshiya Houjou seems to be irresistibly attractive to older men. He can endure some harmless flirting, but once in a while, he receives attention that is considerably unwelcome. Haibara is a regular at the bar who has come to his rescue during one of these occasions.\n\nYoshiya proclaims that he has developed feelings for Haibara, who mistakenly assumes that this is just part of the young man's charming act. However, when Haibara finds himself unwittingly blurting out a love confession, Yoshiya is equally skeptical. Will the two ever come to realize the sincerity of their emotions?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
