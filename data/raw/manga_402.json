    "synopsis": "Fujiwara Sunao is a rather unusual young lady. Not only does she prefer to wear her hair short and dress like a boy, but she also possesses the power to control water! One might think Fujiwara would be an odd fit at her school, but strangely, she's not. Between the destructive and demented school president, the kooky and somewhat stalker-like school nurse, and the obsessed underclassman who wants to be her apprentice, Fujiwara may be the sanest person at the school--which is a big help considering she may be asked to save it! \n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
