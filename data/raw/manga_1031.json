    "synopsis": "All 15-year-old Nanami \"Nana\" Takahashi wants in high school is to make as many friends as possible. However, her inability to follow along with the general gossip of the school, coupled with her failing to remember people's names, gets in the way of her ambitious goals.\n\nOne day, Nana has the displeasure of meeting the popular Motoharu Yano—whom allegedly two-thirds of the girls at school have fallen head-over-heels for. Irritated by Yano's mischievous antics and carefree attitude, Nana declares her hatred for him. But unbeknownst to her, Yano hides a somber burden under his charismatic demeanor: his ex-girlfriend died in a tragic car accident the past summer, and he has since not come to terms with his new reality. To make matters worse, the accident has distorted not only Yano's perception of the world but also his ability to trust those around him.\n\nAs Nana gets closer to the boy, she only finds herself pushed further away. But with her feelings toward Yano beginning to shift, Nana is determined to reach out and help him—or is the problem simply impossible for both of them to handle?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
