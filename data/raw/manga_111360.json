    "synopsis": "For an alchemist like Mariela, performing incredible feats of magic are just part of the job. So when a stampeding horde of monsters threatens to devour the kingdom of Endalsia, she decides to put herself in a brief state of suspended animation to survive. Luckily, she awakens safe and sound—200 years in the future... Now, all Mariela really wants is a quiet, laid-back life in this land she barely recognizes. It's too bad potions have become a luxury good, and she's the only girl in town with the skills to make them.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
