    "synopsis": "Chiwoo's got issues. Upon returning to school after the \"incident\" last year, he vows to keep to himself and stay out of trouble until graduation. Easier said than done: his bad boy reputation has made him the talk of the school, and Kyujin—class president and model student—won't stop being friendly. Trouble arrives soon enough in the shape of Jihyun, a tattooed hunk from Chiwoo's dark past. It's gonna be a tough year...\n\n(Source: Lezhin Comics)",
