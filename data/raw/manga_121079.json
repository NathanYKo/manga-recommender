    "synopsis": "Yoon Bum is a broken, beaten, and scarred human being, whose mental instability and loneliness have led him to unhealthy outlets for his pent up emotions. With his weakened mind, Bum has found solace in watching his handsome classmate Oh Sangwoo; Bum's love runs so deep, in fact, that he has begun stalking him. While creeping in Sangwoo's house one day, Bum makes a horrifying discovery—a torture chamber and a naked young woman tied up, gagged, and pleading for help.\n\nThe life of this woman is doomed, and Bum cannot escape either, as he is soon discovered. His eyes sickening and crazed, Sangwoo takes Bum as his newest pet and victim. What awaits the mentally tortured Bum is a world of physical mutilation, toxic dependence, and abuse masquerading as so-called love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
