    "synopsis": "Kim Hyejung spends her nights gushing about The Flower of the Beast: a fantasy romance novel where the protagonist Ibelin Dott must choose between the affection of three men—the crown prince, a handsome duke, and the master of the magic tower. Despite its cliché premise, the novel is a source of comfort for Hyejung.\n\nOn one of those nights, Hyejung falls asleep from exhaustion and wakes up in the world of The Flower of the Beast. She now inhabits the body of Latte Ectrie, the daughter of a viscount and a supporting character in the novel. With unlikely odds of meeting the male leads on her own, Latte decides to pour her energy into writing boys' love stories until the female lead comes onto the scene.\n\nAfter a decade, Ibelin is about to make her grand appearance at the crown princess' birthday party, and Latte is ready to watch the drama unfold from the sidelines. Little does she know, her antics have caused major changes. By chance, Latte has befriended Ibelin, and Arwin Hebrim—the third and most dangerous male lead—has taken an interest in Latte instead!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
