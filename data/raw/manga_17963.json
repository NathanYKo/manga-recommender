    "synopsis": "On a blind group date, promiscuous college student Takaya Manada falls head over heels for Yurina Mikami. Conversely, Yurina appears shocked to see him, and she leaves the date after he confesses his love. Takaya later recalls that he used to bully Yurina in elementary school, which led her to change schools and develop a bitter hatred toward him over the years. Intending to redeem himself, Takaya asks her to go out with him once more. She agrees, but with an ultimatum: he must do everything she demands.\n\nDespite Yurina's animosity, Takaya is happy to fulfill any of her unreasonable requests if it means he can spend time with her. While Yurina is initially hellbent on exacting her revenge, Takaya's caring and selfless persona quickly begins to sway her feelings. However, standing in the way of their relationship is Rino, a close friend of Takaya who seems to be obsessed with him. Nevertheless, Takaya will do whatever he can to help Yurina recover from her trauma and progress their romance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
