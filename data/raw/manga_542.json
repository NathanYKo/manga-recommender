    "synopsis": "We follow the bumpy and funny romance between bubbly Tamoko and the serious Kanji. With Kanji's father running an idol agency, and Tamoko being the daughter of their top-selling idol, Shinju, things get complicated. Tamako must hide the fact she is Shinju's daughter to save public face, but at the same time, is determined to be his ideal wife (as was promised when they were little kids). It doesn't help that Tamako's pretty clumsy and poor of domestic chores, but no matter what comes down the road, she's not about to give up!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
