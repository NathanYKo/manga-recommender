    "synopsis": "Daily lives of high school students may seem a commonplace concept, but that certainly does not apply to the trio at Tokisadame High. For Yuuko Aioi and her two eccentric friends, every day is a unique experience. From stumbling across a wrestling match between the principal and a deer to indulging in a chopstick battle over a sausage—the excitement never ends.\n\nOne day, their lives take a turn for the bizarre when they encounter an insecure robot maid, her young excitable creator, and their down-to-earth talking cat. To the people in the world of Nichijou, daily life continues to be an endless roller coaster!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Nichijou no Prototype (2 chapters)",
