    "synopsis": "In a world where nobles take pride in their jet-black hair, the red-haired Princess Nakaba of Senan is locked away in a tower until she is forced to marry Caesar, the arrogant second prince of Belquat. Practically a political hostage, Nakaba only has one attendant by her side: Loki, whose dog-like ears mark him as an ajin—a race of beings with animalistic traits who are looked down upon by the general populace.\n\nNakaba—the possession of her conceited husband, the discarded princess of a kingdom that saw her as their shame—expects to endure her pain and continue living life no matter what. However, a splash of crimson blood dyes her world in a red hue, awakening her power—the Arcana of Time. This ability allows her to see the past—her own, which she has locked away, and that of others—and the future.\n\nBut changing the future comes at a price, and to save one life means something else must be sacrificed in return. Amidst the rising tension on the continent, Nakaba must use her power to fight not only for peace, but also to save those she has grown to love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: Chapter count includes extras.",
