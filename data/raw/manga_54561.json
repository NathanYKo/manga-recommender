Haru's had it all since childhood - looks, charisma, good grades, athletic talent and girls, but in this virtual world, Haru would meet the only thing he wants and unable to attain. At the edge of the incomplete world, the love story of a player and a NPC unfolds.\n\n(Source: Horobosu Scanlations)",
