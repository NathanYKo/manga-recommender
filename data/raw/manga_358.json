    "synopsis": "From the creator of Doll and Beautiful People comes a biting black comedy that shows us nothing is scarier than family. Haunted House follows the misadventures of Sabato, a hapless young teen trying to find himself, which is made all but impossible by his flamboyant family (who look like the Addams Family by way of Tim Burton). Scaring away every girl he brings home, Sabato's family seem to revel in his misery, but could there be more to their torment than meets the eye? Rest assured, Mihara-sensei keeps you guessing and giggling every step of the way.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
