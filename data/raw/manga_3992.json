    "synopsis": "In a futuristic Japan, astrologist Tsuneo Ooguro has made a monumental achievement: he has discovered a new planet from another universe. The discovery propels the professor into the public eye, where he is met with accolades, acclaim, and the rights to name the planet. Deciding to let his daughter Remina serve as the namesake, the shy girl quickly finds herself thrust into an uneasy life of stardom.\n\nUnlike its human counterpart, planet Remina shows nothing but odd behavior. Its movements are unpredictable and show no clear orbital patterns. Even more mysterious, any star it nears soon disappears. The enigma heightens when Professor Ooguro's assistant claims that planet Remina has stopped moving and looked him directly in the eye. Before going mad, the assistant announces one final thing: the planet is now heading toward Earth.\n\nSoon enough, planet Remina enters the solar system, leaving a trail of emptiness and causing worldwide panic. In an instant, popular adoration transforms into hostility; the populace have declared that the Ooguros have orchestrated this disaster and must be destroyed to avert it. Now deemed Public Enemy No. 1, Remina must escape a rabid population, all while the looming threat of the hellstar approaches.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot: Okuman Bocchi",
