With the possibility of discovering an intergalactic species on the horizon, scientists everywhere begin a desperate race to develop the most sophisticated technology and send humans to the Red Planet. On the same day at the exact same time, baby Maho Shirafune utters his very first word—\"Mars.\"\n\nYears later, in time for high school applications, the space enthusiast Maho has his sights set on the prestigious Space Academy. The institution only accepts around one percent of applicants, but enrolling in the school will allow Maho to achieve his dream of going to Mars on that determined day. Together with his childhood friend Meguru Hoshihara and classmate Wataru Amachi, Maho begins to take the two-week academy admission test.\n\nFacing dauntless competition from some of the best astronaut prospects, Maho's chances of making it to the top are looking quite grim. Interestingly, the academy's principal, Fifi Collins, suspects that Maho may be a critical part of the July 7 mission. With his fate possibly written in the stars already, Maho braces himself to persevere through this life-changing trial.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
