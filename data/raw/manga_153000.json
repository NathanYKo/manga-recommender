    "synopsis": "Lively teenager Mirai Sarutobi is determined to become a respected ninja, aspiring to match the legacies of her late father, Asuma, and grandfather, Third Hokage Hiruzen. As a regular bodyguard for Seventh Hokage Naruto Uzumaki, the active village leader, she feels she is steadily progressing toward her goal. When entrusted with escorting Sixth Hokage Kakashi Hatake during a border inspection, an eager Mirai senses a chance to establish her reputation by defending Kakashi against countless enemies. But what she anticipates to be a perilous, career-defining two-day mission turns out to be a leisurely 20-day vacation.\n\nReeling from her disappointment, Mirai struggles to enjoy touring hot springs alongside the absent-minded Kakashi and his overzealous friend Guy Might. As Mirai finally relaxes, however, she is suddenly offered a tantalizing opportunity—one that may just be too good to be true.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
