    "synopsis": "Yoonsoo is an average office worker by day. By night, she's the bestselling author, Wasser... until the villain of her series, Prince Einsen Keit, kidnaps her! Now trapped in a world she made, Wasser tries to use her creative powers to grant his demands. But she soon discovers that her influence is limited here. Even more concerning, there are dark beings, including demonic creatures, that she never included in any of her books. But perhaps most concerning of all... Keit is really, really cute!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
