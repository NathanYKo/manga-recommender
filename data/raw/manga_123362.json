    "synopsis": "In the eyes of the public, Fudou Aikawa and Desumi Magahara are sworn enemies who have nothing in common. Fudou, also known as \"Red Gelato,\" is the leader of the hero squadron \"Gelato 5,\" whose mission is to bring about world peace. On the other hand, Desumi is the minion leader of \"Gekko,\" a villainous organization seeking world domination. However, despite these differences, their relationship is not quite what it seems. When they are not making a show of being at each other's throats, Desumi and Fudou continue to pursue a forbidden love.\n\nGoing on dates, baking sweets for one another, and meeting up as often as they can despite their hectic schedules, the two inexperienced lovebirds pave the way for their own unique relationship. Though their public lives are worlds apart, Fudou and Desumi will stop at nothing to make their seemingly impossible romance work.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
