    "synopsis": "Despite being at the top of her middle school class in both grades and athletics, Ayaka Sakurai finds herself stuck with her backup choice for high school due to her tendency to falter under pressure. Recognizing Ayaka's struggles, Michiko Egawa, her homeroom teacher, surprises her with an exchange of favors: if Ayaka can get Sora Honda, her classmate, to stop skipping class, Egawa will write a letter of recommendation to any school Ayaka wants.\n\nAfter her first meeting with Sora, Ayaka reports back to Egawa, but Sora overhears their conversation. With Ayaka's ulterior motive out in the open, Sora agrees to cooperate in coming to school as long as Ayaka obeys one of her requests every day. To seal the deal, Sora first demands a kiss!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
