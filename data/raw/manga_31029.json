    "synopsis": "With the chains of fate finally broken and the best possible world reached, Rika Furude and her friends are free to live their ordinary lives in the mountain village of Hinamizawa. After so many hardships and heartaches, Rika assumes that she will no longer have to worry about anything, but she is soon proven wrong following her involvement in an accident.\n\nUpon waking up from her ordeal, Rika discovers that she is in a different world than the one she knows. This alternate reality differs from her original world in more than a few ways: her best friend Satoko Houjou is cold towards her, her older friend Keiichi Maebara never moved to Hinamizawa, and her parents are alive, among other things. While this world may not be perfect, it does seem appealing to Rika, so she must now make a choice: to stay in this new world, or to go back to the world that she fought so hard to change.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
