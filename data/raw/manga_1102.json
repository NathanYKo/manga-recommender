    "synopsis": "While many of us will probably scream at even the thought of a ghost being near us, freshman Nimura Kensuke just thinks of it as a common everyday thing, seeing as how he has the uncanny ability to see so many of them on a daily basis. Things soon heat up for him when he meets a girl who changes his life from then on. Her name is Kagura, and she has the power to summon a mighty \"spirit devourer\"—otherwise known as a \"Ga-Rei\"—called Byakuei. So, what's Nimura to do? Chase down the evil spirits and and have Kagura summon the Ga-Rei to devour them, of course! Now, come feast on their adventures like some ravenous Ga-Rei!\n\n(Source: Entropy)",
