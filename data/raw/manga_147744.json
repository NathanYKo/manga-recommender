Having moved to a frigid region full of nonflammable wood, Everia calls on archmage Theoharis to warm her home with his azure flame... not realizing that she's bound herself to a lifelong contract! Now that she's master of a bloodthirsty (but breathtakingly handsome) demon dog, can she kiss the quiet life goodbye?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
