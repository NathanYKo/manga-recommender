    "synopsis": "5000 years ago, a young apprentice magician called Asley was the target of ridicule by his academy peers because of his lack of magical talent. Consequently, he shut himself off from the world and decided to live the life of a hermit researcher, accompanied by his Siberian husky familiar and best friend Pochi. During one of his experiments, he accidentally ends up creating the eternal dew, granting eternal life to him and his loyal friend.\n\nThousands of years pass by before the hermit finally decides to venture outside and go on a journey, where he discovers his powers of magicraft clearly stand out, as the art has long been lost. Having no goal in life, Asley sets out to explore a changed world, gradually growing and changing himself as he encounters new companions on the road. But in the process, Asley also unearths signs of dark forces threatening this new world he is growing fond of. The demon king's revival is not too far off, and the declining faith of the people, most of whom have chosen to dogmatically revere mankind's most powerful fighters instead, have left mankind bereft of the holy heroes needed to combat this threat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
