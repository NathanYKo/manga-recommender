    "synopsis": "Ichigo Amano adores cakes, and she dreams of sharing her passion with others one day. While stuffing her face at a sweets festival, Ichigo stumbles across a cake that reminds her of a pastry from her past. This intrigues Henri Lucas—the pâtissièr that made the cake. Impressed by her astute sense of taste, he implores Ichigo to enroll at St. Marie Academy, where they train the next generation of pâtissières in all aspects of creating confections.\n\nOn her first day as a transfer student, Ichigo prays for her success in front of a \"Queen of Sweets Spirits\" statue on campus. She is later placed in a group with the school's legendary \"Sweets Princes\"—three boys at the top of her class, each specializing in a different confectionary discipline. Struggling to keep up with the course material, she faces scrutiny from her classmates for being an amateur despite the praise she received from Henri. Upset that her skills pale in comparison to those of her talented team members, Ichigo vows to use her every waking hour to practice.\n\nSeeing her conviction, a Sweets Spirit named Vanilla answers her wishes and coaches Ichigo through the basics of baking amazing cakes. Vanilla aspires to become one of the Sweets Kingdom's \"Royal Pâtissières,\" but she must first prove her abilities by aiding a human. Using her magic, Vanilla helps elevate Ichigo's techniques and confections to the next level as the two work towards becoming top pâtissières.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Beautiful Dreamer",
