    "synopsis": "Despite the law that forbids human entry, one young witch seeks refuge in the world of demons. Upon arrival, the witch Nicola meets the traveling merchant Simon, who decides to bring her along on his journeys, despite her being a human and him being a demon.\n\nWith their newfound friendship blooming, the duo take off on numerous adventures throughout the demon world—many of which are exciting, charming, or even somewhat perilous! But no matter what happens, Nicola always finds joy in learning more about this fantastical realm; be it by visiting fascinating places, making friends, or uncovering her own magical potential.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
