    "synopsis": "Fifteen years ago, a set of twins—a girl and a boy—was born to the king of Linevan. Shortly after their birth, a prophecy foretold that when the girl turned 16, she would bring about the end of humanity. To avoid this terrible fate, the king ordered the princess disposed of... scrapped!\n\nShe miraculously survived and was raised away from the kingdom that would kill her. But now she has turned 15, and the king's guards have caught wind that she's still alive... and they set out to finish the job!\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
