    "synopsis": "It is my cursed destiny to be reborn endlessly. A king, an archmage, a slave, a saint, a witch... I've done it all in my thousand years of life, and frankly, I need a break! My goal now is simple: to live like an absolute sloth. Unfortunately, I am Rubia, the daughter of a grand duke with a demanding family and a fiancé to boot. To live my dream sloth life, I'm running away from it all... except no matter where I go, nobody will leave me be! I just want to nap, but being lazy is hard work!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
