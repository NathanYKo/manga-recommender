    "synopsis": "Masamune \"Mattsun\" Matsuoka and Tooru \"Yukki\" Yukimura were close friends who promised to become professional soccer players together. However, Yukki moved away in middle school due to his parents' divorce, and Mattsun later believed he lacked talent despite the considerable effort he put into training. Now working as a host solely acknowledged for his pretty face, Mattsun finds himself reminiscing about the past and wondering what Yukki might be doing. \n\nAfter suddenly reuniting with Yukki in a violent encounter, Mattsun discovers that his old friend was also unable to achieve their shared dream. Rather, he has become a shut-in who writes erotic manga and only leaves his home for one reason: to take part in survival games, a sport where combatants aim to \"kill\" each other with fake guns and bullets. Just like old times, Yukki invites his friend to play alongside him, but Mattsun worries about alienating others if it appears that he is trying too hard to succeed. Torn between longing for the carefree days of his childhood and desiring to overcome his shortcomings as an adult, Mattsun now has the opportunity to reconcile with his past and make strides toward the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu was first serialized as a oneshot in Monthly GFantasy on June 18, 2012. It is dissimilar to the narrative of both the manga and anime series, as the history and personalities of childhood friends Masamune Matsuoka and Tooru Yukimura differ slightly.",
