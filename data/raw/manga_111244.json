    "synopsis": "Finally realizing her dream of becoming a nursery school teacher, Karen Kawai has a tiny problem—she has the ultimate villain-face. At a glimpse of her appearance, the little students spill tears and run away. While Karen praises the coroner-turned-nursery teacher Taihei Hosaka for his capability and physical attractiveness, he instead reprimands her failure in acclimating with the class. According to him, it is not a matter of her face but because she does not converse enough with the children.\n\nAs Karen slowly learns how to have a proper conversation, Hosaka suddenly proposes to her. Surely he can't be serious!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
