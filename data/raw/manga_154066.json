    "synopsis": "\"You, too, will be corrupted. Then I will make it all come true.\"\n\nIf I had only joined hands with him and agreed to become his mistress then, could I have lived a little longer? At least I would not have know the pain of my eyes being gouged out. But instead I shouted: \"I refuse. I will not betray my country,\" not realizing that my country, my family, had betrayed me long ago. Sacrificed, used, abandoned, and finally executed by my own family... I only realized after returning to 10 years in the past that the reason why you wanted me to stand by your side is because you and I were so much alike. Let us fall together this time.\n\n(Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",
