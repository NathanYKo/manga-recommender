    "synopsis": "Ayato Nakasone is a transfer student with a unique predisposition: as soon as he takes off his glasses, people in close proximity tend to fall in love with him. Unfortunately, Ayato cannot seem to escape the endless troubles caused by his powers, as they prove effective even at his new school full of delinquents. However, the most notorious student of them all—Yuusei Horiguchi—appears immune to his allure.\n\nSoon enough, Ayato becomes fascinated by the delinquent who is unaffected by his curse. Equally intrigued, Yuusei claims Ayato as his own, and thus begins their odd relationship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
