    "synopsis": "On the Hawaiian Islands, siblings Dragona and Jodio Joestar commit petty crimes to provide aid for their ailing mother Barbara Ann. Under the orders of Meryl May Qi, both a crime lord and their high school principal, the siblings work alongside fellow teenagers Usagi Alohaoe and Paco Laburantes. Together, the gang engages in outright robbery, fraudulent activity, and other schemes to rip off unsuspecting tourists and civilians.\n\nFifteen-year-old Jodio admires his older brother's strong sense of identity and his mother's incredible work ethic, but there is a darkness within him, one characterized by violent outbursts that he carries out with a cold stoicism. Diagnosed as a sociopath, Jodio is quick to brutalize those who threaten his loved ones. His one objective is to make money by any means necessary, both to support his family and to become filthy rich in his own right.\n\nOn one particular heist, the gang robs manga artist Rohan Kishibe of a seemingly ordinary lava rock. However, they soon find that the rock draws any object of high value that it touches to its wielder, no matter the distance or bizarre chain of circumstances it takes to get there. With this new power in hand, Jodio and his allies set out to become wealthier than they ever dreamed possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
