    "synopsis": "Whenever Suiren Shibazeki walks by, heads turn due to her captivatingly cute looks. In elementary school, boys would pay too much attention to her, to the point where she avoided them altogether. In middle school, she attended an all-girls school in the hopes of escaping all the unwanted attention, but she was still smothered by her classmates' coddling. As a result, Suiren now rarely speaks and maintains an expressionless face.\n\nAdvancing to high school, Suiren returns to a co-ed school and is once again the center of attention. The boys refer to her as \"Takane no Hana,\" flower on a high peak, unreachable and idolized from afar. However, one boy outside her sea of admirers catches her eye—Kouha Kawasumi, a talented karate student who is just as quiet as her. While he may not return her immediate affection, Kouha saves her from a group of boys, jump-starting the heartwarming romance that blossoms between the two soft-spoken youths.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
