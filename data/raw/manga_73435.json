    "synopsis": "Strawberry \"Berry\" Shin is one of the few females in a male-dominated school. With her godlike status, it's no wonder she is a narcissist and has caught the interest of her wealthy upperclassman, Pierre \"Pear\" Kang. Unfortunately, Berry has to learn to deal with his friend, Walnut \"Wally\" Kang, who seemingly hates her for no reason. And to make matters worse, her ex-boyfriend, Mandarin \"Darin\" Kim, is not too happy with her new relationship.\n\nDarin's solution: cross-dress as the mysterious new transfer student \"Cherry Kim\" and make Pear fall in love with him instead. Thus begins the rule of a new queen at Sausage Fest Private High School of Engineering. What is a girl to do when her new boyfriend is falling in love with her (admittedly prettier) ex-boyfriend?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
