Now comfortable with their feelings for each other, they are not afraid to show their affection, whether that be Haru surprising Aki with a kiss while he works from home or an intense hugging session upon arriving home from work. With each passing day, the young lovebirds find sweet ways to express their love for one another!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
