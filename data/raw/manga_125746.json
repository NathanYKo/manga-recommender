    "synopsis": "Kenshirou Midou is a popular student who harbors a secret: despite being a boy, he has always loved the art of cosmetics. Because of his efforts to keep this low profile, only his sisters and Hiura Mihate, a childhood friend, know his hidden obsession. Apart from his siblings, Hiura is Kenshirou's only hope at realizing his potential.\n\nKenshirou begs Hiura to let him practice applying makeup on him, and when Hiura finally succumbs to his request, the drastic transformation shocks Kenshirou. From the appearance of a dull, slender boy to a charming petite girl, Hiura's new look evokes something in Kenshirou.\n\nOn the other hand, Hiura has had feelings for Kenshirou long before his dramatic change. Often watching from the sidelines, Hiura thinks that a romantic relationship with him is beyond his reach. But with the revelation of Kenshirou's unusual hobby, Hiura remains optimistic and decides to devote himself to his friend's passion. As their affection for one another intensifies, the pair slowly develops an unbreakable bond.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
