    "synopsis": "The story starts off with a bunch of high school students, taking the dare to go up to this abandoned building that has been half destroyed by a fire. It was rumoured to be haunted. Just a rumour, right? Not when real corpses start showing up, and they start feeling things grabbing them, and finally zombies going after them! Shikabane Hime is there to save the day. The immortal girl, \"Shikabane Hime,\" has the mission to \"kill\" 108 corpses. It's a contract she has between herself and the Buddhist monk, Keisei. After 108 corpses, she will finally get her happiness and go to heaven.\n\n(Source: MU)",
