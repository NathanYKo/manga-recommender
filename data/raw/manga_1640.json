But as they grow older, how will each of their lives change? Will they grow apart, or stay true to the (perverted) passions they shared as kids. D-ASH is a story about the adventures these boys will have trying to grow up as fast as they can, being as naughty as possible all the while.\n\n(Source: Anime Waves Scanlations)",
