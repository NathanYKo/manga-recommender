    "synopsis": "Every day, Ten Serizawa boards the 6:00 a.m. bus and travels two long hours to get to school. She is perfectly content with her decision to commute from home, even though there is a boarding house just seven minutes away from her school. However, it also means that Ten can never spend enough time with her friends after school.\n\nTen does not mind missing out on all the fun until one day, her friend Ageha Haruna brings her to the boarding house that she has been living at. What Ten does not expect is the fluttery excitement that comes with sharing a space with one's schoolmates. As the day progresses, her resolve wavers and she finds herself second-guessing her living arrangements.\n\nJust when she is struggling with her dilemma, a couple of strange encounters with the solemn Chiaki Kasedera and the casual Riku Mikuhara ultimately lead Ten to a realization—she cannot wait to try living in the boarding house.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
