    "synopsis": "\"Love isn't for me.\" That is what Tsugumi Koeda, a first-year high school student always told herself. Her small-framed, flat body has given Koeda a serious complex, making it totally impossible for her to ever imagine falling in love. That is, until one day when Masamune Sena, a boy from the next class sees her thin, boyish body by accident... Since then, whenever Tsugumi's with the natural and frank Masamune, the feelings she's held back, feelings that she wants to be \"a girl\" like everybody else start to grow more and more...\n\nThis is a pure and slow-step love story dedicated to all the girls who find things awkward when it comes to love!\n\n(Source: Kodansha Comics USA)",
