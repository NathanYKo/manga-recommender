    "synopsis": "Makoto Kusakabe is an uptight and virtuous office worker who wants nothing to do with love and sexual desire. His next-door neighbor, Hiiragi, always greets him every morning before heading off to work, but Kusakabe refuses to respond for fear of falling in love with her. \n\nOne morning, before they each head to work, Hiiragi asks Kusakabe for a strange favor: to hand over the bag of used tissues in his hand. Hiiragi is a succubus who should live off indecent acts against men, but her shyness prevents her from fulfilling her duties. Stunned by her boldness, Kusakabe struggles to focus at work as he broods over the request.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
