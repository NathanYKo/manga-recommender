    "synopsis": "Energetic and strong-willed, Beni doesn't care if she lives or dies as long as her death will result in embarrassing her arrogant father! But one day, she suddenly encounters a Kagetora, a ninja who's fallen from the sky and swears complete loyalty to her—as her bodyguard. Kagetora has time traveled from a long, long time ago, and has devoted his life to protecting Princess Beni. Little does Kagetora know that this Beni is not the real princess... Can true love and honor survive after centuries-long time warp—in a crazy modern world?\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",
