Determined to find his special someone, he turns to a matchmaking service. But while waiting for his perfect soulmate to be found, he goes into heat at the worst possible moment—alone with Kotani, a new coworker who nurses a longtime grudge against Shishikura! After they spend a desperate, steamy night together, there's no doubt that the two are physically compatible, but do they even like each other?\n\n(Source: SuBLime)",
