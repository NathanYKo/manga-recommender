But though these ladies spend much of their day battling sickness, their after-hours are spent fighting a very different sort of disease... Under the leadership of the hospital chairman, a handful of staff members and local teenagers form a group of mercenary assassins, targeting the \"cancers\" of society and excising those individuals before their wickedness spreads.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
