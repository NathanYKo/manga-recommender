    "synopsis": "\"The Age of Transmigration\" is a concerning, worldwide phenomenon where people on the verge of death receive spam text messages about a life insurance package. With her life cut short, a woman receives the cryptic message before waking up in the afterlife. There, she is given a choice on which fictional world she would like to be reincarnated in.\n\nAfter dealing with many hardships in her past life, the woman desires to be a child in a fantasy romance novel, famously known for having easy-going plots. To her misfortune, she is transmigrated into Infinite Returns to Save the World—a story with S-Class difficulty, where death is a reoccuring instance. She awakens as Ailette Rodeline, the daughter of a servant who works under an aristocratic family. In the original novel, the next family head canonically abused the main character, leading toward the tragic ending of the entire household.\n\nLuckily, the woman's life as Ailette is not as doomed as she thought; without her knowledge, she had bought the insurance's full package. As a result, she is given an unimaginable amount of cash to spend on skills and other special items. In order to avoid Ailette's original deadly fate, the woman must become strong and fend for herself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
