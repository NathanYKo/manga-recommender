    "synopsis": "The mighty Leon has long ruled over Dark Fall. But when he mysteriously loses his powers, his obedient followers turn into dangerous enemies. And it isn't simple revenge that they're after. Instead, they want him to bear a new king of Dark Fall in his womb, while becoming their plaything in the process. Soon, Leon's budding libido is stimulated for this very purpose, and Dark Fall's once-great ruler is brought to his knees.\n\n(Source: Lezhin Entertainment)",
