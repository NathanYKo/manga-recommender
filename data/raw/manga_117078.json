    "synopsis": "Tall, busty high schooler Hitomi Takano has shark teeth, a looming presence, and a truly terrifying face. As an upperclassman named Yuu Usami finds out, however, looks can be deceiving. Beneath her massive frame and intense glare, Hitomi-chan is a sweet girl who just wants to overcome her social anxiety and make some friends. As Yuu gets to know her, they grow close—so close that maybe friendship won't be enough! Don't miss this charming romcom between a scary-but-sweet girl and her smaller, loving senpai.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
