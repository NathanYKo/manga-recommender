    "synopsis": "Alejandro \"Liandro\" Cyril Bellavitti was just another secondary male lead who met a terrible end. Cursed from a young age, he was an outcast in his own home, devoid of his parents' love and neglected by the servants. In real-life Korea, a young woman cries for the pitiful character, wholeheartedly hoping he finds happiness. Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, she discovers herself in the very novel she had been reading.\n\nNow known as \"Evelina\"—one of many nameless maids—she tends to the young and bedridden Liandro. Accustomed to the scorn of others, Liandro initially rejects her kindness. However, through tender care and consideration, Evelina eventually makes him open up. That is, until she accidentally lifts his curse, a role that was supposed to be fulfilled by the heroine.\n\nHaving effectively redirected the course of the story, all Evelina can do is wait to uncover what fate awaits her and Liandro—but this mistake may prove to be the catalyst that drives them apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
