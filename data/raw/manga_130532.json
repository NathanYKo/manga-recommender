    "synopsis": "The magician Chrome Walker thought he had it all—a beautiful lover, a dependable best friend, and loyal companions. But like a whisper in the wind, that all disappears when the people he called family drop Chrome into the pits of despair, using his hatred to nourish their party's hero.\n\nAs he is left to die in agony, Chrome's steadfast desire to continue living awakens in him the skill \"Fixed Damage,\" an EX-level trait that inflicts a set amount of damage every few seconds on those within a certain radius. With a new lease on life, Chrome vows revenge. He will not show mercy, and he will keep living until he sees his goal through to the end—all that remains in his tattered heart is a deep hatred that craves bloody vengeance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
