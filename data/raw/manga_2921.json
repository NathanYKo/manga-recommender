    "synopsis": "Seika High School was an all-boys school, but it has since turned co-ed. Misaki Ayuzawa is the first female student council president of the school, eventually earning the nickname of the \"Demon President\" due to her mastery of Aikido and imposed iron rule.\n\nHowever, Misaki harbors an embarrassing secret—she has to work at a maid café to support her family. If anybody from her school was to find out, her reputation would be utterly destroyed. And after Takumi Usui—the most popular boy at school—discovers her secret, that might just happen. Kaichou wa Maid-sama! follows their story as they spend more time together and eventually begin to understand each other's secrets.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Toumei na Sekai (Transparent World)",
