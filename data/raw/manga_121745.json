    "synopsis": "Due to her unfathomably glamorous looks and raw sex appeal, Hibiki Akasaka has always been compared to Marilyn Monroe. However, beneath this veneer of allure is a girl who simply wants to be loved. Unfortunately for her, she only seems to draw lascivious gazes, and even her mere sighs are erotic enough to get boys' blood pumping.\n\nTo make matters worse, Hibiki's beloved boyfriend dumped her, citing her looks as being too much for him to handle. Fresh off of the breakup, she is not looking for another man. That is, until her classmate Daichi Aoyama confesses in an outrageous fashion: he asks her to be his mistress! Although reluctant at first, Hibiki decides to give love another chance as Aoyama resolves to treasure her. However, Aoyama faces a seemingly insurmountable hurdle. As the world keeps throwing the pair into one tantalizing situation after another, can he hold back his desires and impending nosebleed?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
