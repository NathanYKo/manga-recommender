When she discovers he works for a host club—where women actually pay men to date them—will she finally wise up? Or will he leave his job to be with her? Or will she take a job at the club so he can quit so she can be with him so...? Only one thing's for sure in B.O.D.Y.—you can't put a price on love!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Saa Kyou mo Gakkou da",
