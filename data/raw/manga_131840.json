    "synopsis": "Wade Winston Wilson does not consider himself a hero despite sporting a superhero-like black-and-red costume and fighting under the name \"Deadpool.\" Rather than following a strict moral code, Deadpool's actions are dictated by money. When billionaire Anthony \"Tony\" Stark offers the mercenary a job in Tokyo, Deadpool is fully primed to take down an evil organization headed by the God of Mischief, Loki, who aims to seize control over Japan.\n\nAs Deadpool travels to his next zany escapade, he encounters Sakura Spider, a young girl with a familiar yet unimpressive backstory. She is by no means a fan of Deadpool and his unconventional methods, but in the face of a formidable enemy, her strong sense of responsibility and inability to fight alone outweigh any hesitation to join forces. With Sakura Spider on board, Deadpool caps off his team with Neiro Aratabi, a popular idol housing a symbiote in her body. Combining their powers, the trio must work together to save Japan—so Deadpool can safely collect his paycheck.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
