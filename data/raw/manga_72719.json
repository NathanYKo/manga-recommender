    "synopsis": "Rather than accepting responsibility for his debts, Shion Adachi's father sends her to the flower shop he borrowed money from to work in his place. The 17-year-old delinquent is even more displeased to be living with 25-year-old florist Shun Mamyuuda. Nonetheless, Shion has no choice but to accept these burdens and spend her month off from school working to repay her father's dues.\n\nAt first, Shion believes that Mamyuuda has ulterior motives for allowing her to help out around the store. But when he proves her suspicions false, she cannot help but wonder why a complete stranger is offering her a hand. Shion soon assumes the responsibility of preparing the flowers, with each of her bouquets bringing a smile to customers' faces. Through the language of flowers, Shion begins to appreciate both the situation she has found herself in and Mamyuuda's true intentions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
