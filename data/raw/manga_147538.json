    "synopsis": "Ten years ago, a group of gods turned everyone on Earth into players of a sadistic game that forced them to kill monsters in real life—or be killed themselves. Sehan Kim has already seen how this game will play out: everyone in the world dies except for him. When he's given the chance to go back in time and start a second playthrough, Sehan is determined to change the course of events and beat the gods at their own game.\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
