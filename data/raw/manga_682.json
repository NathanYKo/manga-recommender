Karin and Kiriya embark on a romantic journey despite Karin's classmate Yuka's best efforts to sabotage their relationship, but Karin soon learns that living happily ever after isn't on the curriculum when she becomes Kiriya's center of attention, as well as embittered Yuka's bull's-eye on her dartboard of hate.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 10: Kiriya at 13 (Spring)",
