    "background": "Frankenstein is an adaptation of Mary Shelley's 1818 gothic horror novel of the same title. While generally a faithful adaptation, the story diverges from the original in the final third where Junji Itou provides his unique spin on the story. In 2019, it won the Eisner Award in the Best Adaptation from Another Medium category. Frankenstein and Jigoku no Ningyousou were published in English (the latter as The Hell of the Doll Funeral) by VIZ Media as a part of their Frankenstein: Junji Ito Story Collection. Meanwhile, Real Unko no Omoide was published in English as Memories of Real Poop as part of VIZ Media's Lovesickness: Junji Ito Story Collection.",
