But being the ripe old age of 28 might be working against her, and her spontaneous displays of violence aren't helping either! Not all hope is lost, however—she might be perfect for the role offered by a mysterious and charming new man in her life. Can Chloé become the Ghost Reaper Girl and take down the evil spirits that have escaped from Hades?\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
