    "synopsis": "Twenty years ago, Yuuichi Aizawa suffered through insurmountable bullying, ultimately culminating in him dropping out of middle school. Riddled with the signs of cigarette butts and gouged out skin, Aizawa's body is a testament to what he was forced to endure. All this time, he has not forgotten those who turned a blind eye or those who laughed in glee, but the memory of none lingers quite as vividly as Shinji Suzuki, the ringleader of his tormentors. With a successful career, lovely wife, and cheerful daughter, Suzuki is living life to the fullest, never facing adversity. However, he is unaware that his daughter, Shiori, has recently been assigned a new homeroom teacher—Aizawa himself.\n\nHolding onto the pain of his past, Aizawa has his own agenda for how to handle his class. Meanwhile, Suzuki claims that it is the fault of the victim who suffers from bullying, too weak to stand up for themselves. But will he be able to say the same when his loved one becomes the next victim?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
