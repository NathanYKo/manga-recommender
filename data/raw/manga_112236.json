    "synopsis": "For many years, the Republic of San Magnolia has been at war with the neighboring Giadian Empire. Faced with the relentless might of the Empire's Legion of autonomous drones, the Republic counters with unmanned weapons of their own, creating a battlefield that is supposedly without casualties. However, beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five Republic territories lies the \"nonexistent\" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, pilot the \"unmanned\" weapons into battle...\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
    "background": "Following a hiatus starting in July 2021, 86 was canceled in June 2022 due to Motoki Yoshihara's poor health. The series was published in English as 86: Eighty-Six by Yen Press from December 15, 2020 to October 4, 2022. It was also released in French by Delcourt-Tonkam from March 16, 2022, to November 9, 2022.",
