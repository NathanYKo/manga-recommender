    "synopsis": "The Antinoids are a mysterious race of monsters who have secretly come to Earth in order to conquer it. While most of the population remains unaware, the heroine Rapid Rabbit fights against these evil fiends.\n\nIn a particularly tough battle, Honey Trap—one of the Antinoid's Executive Officers—sees Rapid Rabbit without her mask and learns her true identity. But just as she obtains the upper hand, Honey Trap flees with a flushed face, confusing Rapid Rabbit. As it turns out, Rapid Rabbit is Honey Trap's ideal type.\n\nReturning to her organization with nothing but a new crush, Honey Trap is exiled from the Antinoids and left with nowhere to go. Roaming the lone streets, she is eventually rescued by none other than Rapid Rabbit after collapsing near her apartment. Having no one else to turn to, Honey Trap decides to team up with Rapid Rabbit and get revenge on the Antinoids.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
