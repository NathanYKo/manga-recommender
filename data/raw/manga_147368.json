    "synopsis": "Pereshati Zahardt may be the sole heir to her late father's county, but she can at least rely on her stepmother, stepsister Reina, and loving fiancé Schiff. However, she soon finds herself proven wrong, landing her on her deathbed. Schiff wedded Pereshati at the behest of Reina—his true lover—so they could promptly inherit Pereshati's fortune and title. Defenseless, Pereshati can only watch as her loved ones turn against her.\n\nShockingly, Pereshati somehow wakes up in the past, mere months after her father's passing. Although uncertain whether the betrayal she experienced was real, she takes precautions moving forward in her second chance. She seeks out Grand Duke Therdeo Lapileon, a war hero with a bloody reputation, and proposes a one-year contract marriage that will ward off their respective unwanted suitors.\n\nUnfortunately, Pereshati fails to account for the Lapileons' family secret: their blood is toxic to everyone who comes in contact with it. Thus, Therdeo resists her request until they discover that Pereshati is immune to Lapileon blood. Under the temporary protection of her in-laws, Pereshati must find a way to enact her revenge. However, she also hopes that she can mend the broken bonds of her new family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
