    "synopsis": "Eishi is one of those popular guys that are smart, good looking, and is good at sports. However, he thinks people and \"love\" are bothersome and would rather not deal with either of them. When his teacher told him to help this girl, Uta, to study, he dreaded the idea of having to stick with such an annoying girl. Soon, though, his heart starts to lighten up towards her. \n\n(Source: Intercross)",
