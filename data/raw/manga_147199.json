    "synopsis": "The story of a middle aged man doing whatever he wants with the power of 1-click online shopping!\n\nKenichi, a single man in his 40s, is transported into another world for no apparent reason. As he tries to escape a dangerous forest teaming with monsters, he realizes he has the power to access to a huge online store.\n\nBy using this power to exchange goods he found in this new world for cash, and then buying modern ones off the internet, he was able to quickly create a very popular business. However, his goal is to have a slow and leisurely life. Instead of growing his business even more, he decides to settle down and live off of the power of Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe mail order life of a middle aged man in other world begins now!\n\n(Source: MU)",
