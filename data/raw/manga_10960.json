    "synopsis": "Since childhood, Anís Yamamoto has worn a protective talisman from her father, in the form of a black choker adorned with a silver rose. But now that she is a first year student at Shoubi Academy, Anís considers it to be more of a curse than a blessing. She cannot remove it no matter how hard she tries, and due to its presence, she receives constant attention from the rest of the school.\n\nOne day, a bat-like creature appears out of nowhere and crashes into Anís' head. During its escape, an elegant red rose card is left behind and her choker goes missing. Reminded that a severe punishment awaits her should she ever take it off, Anís frantically begins to search for the lost item. This search leads her to learn that she is the Rose Princess, the sovereign of four Rose Knights: Kaede Higa, the offensive Red Rose; Mitsuru Tenjou, the defensive White Rose; Seiran Asagi, the alchemy-skilled Blue Rose, and Mutsuki Kurama, the discovery-centered Black Rose. They are all the most popular boys at her school, and with only a kiss to their respective cards, Anís can now summon their presence and magical abilities!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
