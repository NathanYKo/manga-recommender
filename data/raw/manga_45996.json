    "synopsis": "The people of the Kurta Clan live deep in the forest, far from the presence of outsiders. Susceptible to prejudice and discrimination because of their scarlet eyes, they remain hidden from the general public, letting only a distinct few clan members venture outside.\n\nBut after helping Sheila—a woman who found herself stranded in the forest—Kurapika and his best friend Pyro become fascinated with the outside world. In order to achieve his dreams of exploring life beyond the forest, Kurapika must pass the clan elder's three tests in order to be granted permission.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
