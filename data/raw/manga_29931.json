    "synopsis": "Yukiteru Tamaki and his childhood friend Yuno Kirishima are in a relationship, and outwardly, things seem perfect. But Yukiteru has a secret: he has actually been sleeping with their friend, Rena Saotome, ever since she confessed to him. Though Yukiteru plans to tell Yuno, he soon finds himself juggling both girls, with Yuno being none the wiser.\n\nBut things get more complicated when Kaori Yumeno sees Yukiteru and Saotome having sex on the rooftop. She agrees to keep quiet—for a price. The price is, of course, Yukiteru's body. With all of these girls in his life, Yukiteru has no shortage of intimate partners. But what will happen when Yuno finds out?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
