    "synopsis": "Novelist Shun Mizorogi is content with the mundaneness of his life that came along with his pseudo-celebrity status. However, it all comes crumbling down when it is revealed that a young woman, Aki Fujino, had called him moments before plunging to her death. When Mizorogi is summoned by the police to confirm the identity of the mangled corpse, he is informed of the existence of Sakura Miki—a spitting image of Aki and allegedly her identical twin sister—about whom little is known.\n\nBut as the nature of Mizorogi and Aki's relationship comes to light, his latest book \"Utsubora\" brings about a troublesome public controversy. The unraveling of lies and deceit binds the fate of several people involved in this unsavory affair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
