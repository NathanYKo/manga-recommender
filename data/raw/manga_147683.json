    "synopsis": "High-spirited Kim Min-ji and striking beauty Kang Yu-na have been best friends since high school. Now in college, their friendship has deepened enough that Min-ji feels comfortable telling Yu-na she had a vivid and steamy dream about her. Min-ji is oblivious to the effect her confession has on Yu-na, but others notice that Yu-na is in love—and even seek to take advantage of it.\n\nMin-ji, new to love and eager for experience, accepts a date with a man. But memories of her lustful dream and the way Yu-na makes her heart race refuse to leave her mind. Filled with confusion, Min-ji decides to confront Yu-na with these feelings. While Yu-na is overly elated to discover that her love might be mutual, Min-ji's uncertainty complicates their relationship. Ultimately, Min-ji must choose between pursuing the man interested in her or her own increasingly passionate affections for Yu-na.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
