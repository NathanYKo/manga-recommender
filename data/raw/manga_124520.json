    "synopsis": "Ryou Watari is a boy born in the body of a girl. Rejected for being a \"tomboyish girl\" and a transgender boy, he cannot confide in anyone and suffers in the prison of his own skin. Subtly, he expresses his genuine self through a buzzcut and secret purchases of boys' clothes.\n\nHowever, Ryou's life changes when Jin Satou joins his class. Jin is laidback, fearless, and straightforward. He is not ashamed of his interests, nor does he care about others' opinions. For the first time ever, instead of envy, Ryou feels admiration. After running into Ryou in a men's fashion store, Jin proposes the unexpected: they should start a clothing brand together.\n\nOverwhelmed and afraid, Ryou confesses everything to Jin. To his surprise, Jin is fully accepting. Honored to have his first genuine friend and a trusting partner, Ryou agrees to set their business in motion. Recruiting a photographer and collaborating with talented outcasts, the boys prepare to express themselves through fashion and change the world—one step at a time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
