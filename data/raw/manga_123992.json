    "synopsis": "As Kiyotaka Ayanokouji and his classmates begin their second-year life, changes are seen everywhere throughout Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School. With the third-years having graduated and incoming first-years entering the school, alliances are well underway. Additionally, now that Miyabi Nagumo is the student council president, the promise of turning the school into a meritocracy may become a reality.\n\nMeanwhile, conflicts between classes continue to build as the class point totals draw close. With another special exam looming ahead, will Ayanokouji remain in the shadows, or will he finally enter the spotlight and help his class rise to the illustrious Class A?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
