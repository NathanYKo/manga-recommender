    "synopsis": "Hana and Hina are two high school girls working at the same character goods shop, but they are completely different from one another. Hana is petite, uncertain and shy, while Hina is tall, confident, and trendy. Yet they share a secret: their school has a strict policy against taking part-time jobs. They also discover that both of them share an irresistible attraction to things that are cute, be it the uniforms at their all-girls' school or... each other! Just how long will Hana and Hina be able to keep their after school jobs, and their feelings for each other, a secret?\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
