    "synopsis": "Uru is a very short girl and is constantly mistaken for an elementary school kid, but despite that, she is ridiculously strong and decides to live by herself after her mother gets remarried. She ends up working at a small cafe with two rather unique co-workers, Shindou, who acts gruff and intimidating, but who is really a nice guy who loves to make cakes and pies and the like, and Ichirou, who is really good-looking but who instantly falls asleep when he gets hungry and doesn't wake up again until he's force-fed something? What will the future bring to them?\n\n(Source: MU)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 2: Suitei Seinen Shoujo\nVolume 4: Hana to Ageha, Natsu.\nVolume 7: Number One DX",
