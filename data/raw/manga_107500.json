    "synopsis": "Upon an isolated island lies a school that houses the future heroes of the world. The student body, composed only of individuals with inhuman powers known as \"the Talented,\" train to eventually eradicate the wicked \"Enemies of Humanity\" from existence.\n\nThe self-proclaimed elite class is introduced to two new transfer students, Kyouya Onodera and Nana Hiiragi. Their classmates enquire about their abilities, and where Kyouya bluntly refuses to share and asks to be left alone, Nana—possessing a natural charm and a supposed talent of mind-reading—enamors the class. Yet despite the class's enthusiasm for her, she herself takes an odd interest in a reclusive student named Nanao Nakajima, who is often bullied for allegedly lacking an actual ability. As Nana warm-heartedly grows closer to him, her actions place Nanao in a position he had always dreamed of, even if for just a brief moment...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
