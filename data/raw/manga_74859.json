    "synopsis": "In the distant future, Japan strives to be an ideal society. As a way to maintain peace, the Sibyl System is established: it serves as a method to measure emotion, desire, or a thought that deviates from the norm—also dubbed as one's \"Psycho-Pass.\" However, crime has yet to be eradicated; the Public Safety Bureau's Inspectors utilize Denominators, lethal weapons that evaluate an individual's Psycho-Pass, to catch and deal with the immoral outlaws.\n\nInspector Shinya Kougami, along with his unit, Division 03, has been tasked with finding the criminal behind \"The Branding Case.\" But as the detectives delve deeper into the unusual incident, it soon turns unexpectedly sinister.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
