    "synopsis": "Touge Yuugiri is a chick magnet. Without lifting a finger, girls vie for his attention, \"accidentally\" topple on him, or even invite him to spend some special time alone—it's almost as if he is the protagonist of a harem manga! But Touge could not care less about the attention, as he is gay and feels nothing toward the opposite gender's affection. Yet all his attempts to escape, reject, or scare them away have the complete opposite effect, only intensifying the girls' admiration—as if some cosmic interference was at work. Bombarded by nonsensically perverted situations and unwanted sentiments, Touge's life spirals into a living hell, truly reflecting how one man's dream can be another's nightmare.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
