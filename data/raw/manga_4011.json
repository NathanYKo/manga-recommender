But when Kain meets Mel Fredericks, he realizes at once that his whole world is about to change. For the first time Kain wants more than a one-night stand, but a relationship carries risks, discovery not least among them. Battling with others' expectations and biases—and his own—Kain struggles to balance his desire for secrecy with his feelings for Mel at a time when being out could cost him dearly...\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
