    "synopsis": "A mysterious request leads Wendy Marvell and her feline companion Charles to Nanalu Village, only to find that the job requester does not actually exist. Instead, Wendy becomes friends with Yoshino: a girl her age and the only mage in the village. Wendy soon learns that the villagers have slowly been disappearing, supposedly because of a dead dragon's curse. With only herself and Charles to take on the task, Wendy is determined to help Yoshino save the village.\n\nFairy Tail: Blue Mistral depicts Wendy and Charles' adventures soon after joining Fairy Tail. Wendy faces the ghost of a dragon, a cursed mansion, and other tough challenges, desperate to prove herself as a Fairy Tail member.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
