    "synopsis": "Since no one else at her agency is capable of the task, 16-year-old idol Julia Tachibana is assigned to mentor 15-year-old newcomer Ran Asakawa. While she downright refuses at first, Julia has a change of heart after meeting the girl in question—becoming immediately attached to her.\n\nAs she often finds herself trying to impress Ran, Julia quickly comes to realize that she has feelings for her. She should find this conflicting, as the pursuit of a relationship between two girls could cause a scandal that would ruin her career—but she does not seem to care. In fact, she sees getting closer to Ran as more important than being successful!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
