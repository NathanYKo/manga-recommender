    "synopsis": "It is the year 1429—France is embroiled in the arduous Hundred Years' War against England, where the English are steadily driving their opponent toward bitter defeat. However, the tides of the battle unexpectedly turn with the arrival of Jeanne d'Arc: a young maiden who not only wields immense power but also possesses the ability to hear the voice of the angel. Proving her prowess on the battlefield, Jeanne is soon hailed as a miracle, reinvigorating and rallying the French to continue their uphill campaign.\n\nWhile she leads the crusade to liberate France from its English invaders, Jeanne gradually adjusts to her new role as a magical girl with the help of her close confidant, Riz Hawkwood. Their unique abilities enable them to boldly fight a two-front war against \"witches\" and other magical girls with sinister intentions. But as the beacon of light from Jeanne's cause grows ever stronger, so does the darkness that lurks behind the theater of war.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
