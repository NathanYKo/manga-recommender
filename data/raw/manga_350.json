    "synopsis": "Hana Suzuki loves only two things in life: eating and sleeping. So when handsome classmate Izumi Oda asks Hana–his major crush–to join the school hockey club, persuading her proves to be a difficult task. True, the Grand Hockey Club is full of boys–and all the boys are super-cute–but given a choice, Hana prefers a sizzling steak to a hot date. Then Izumi mentions the field trips to fancy resorts. Now Hana can’t wait for the first away game, with its promise of delicious food and luxurious linens. Of course there’s also the getting up early, working hard, and playing well with others. How will Hana survive?\n\n(Source: Del Rey)",
