Each time Saki frequently visits his favorite café, Jun rushes to his side to take his order, but ends up flushed in the face. No matter what he does to change things in his life, Jun always gets poked fun of by his coworkers and teased by his lover. Will this stop Jun and Saki from continuing to be lovey-dovey as they always are?\n\n(Source: MU)",
