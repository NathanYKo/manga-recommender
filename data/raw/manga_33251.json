    "synopsis": "College student Rikiya Higuchi knows he likes men, but he has never had a boyfriend. In a moment of courage, he signs up for a gay dating website, hoping to find a man willing to build a relationship together. Rikiya soon takes a liking to a pen pal—the first man to write to him—and agrees to meet up with him. But he is tricked and wakes up in front of a camera, about to have intercourse with his captor. Desperate to escape, Rikiya cries for help, and unexpectedly, a person materializes out of the walls!\n\nBy accident, Rikiya summoned Endo Guar Adroone—a high-class demon with a bad attitude—alongside his bird butler. As he removes Rikiya's retainers, Endo announces that Rikiya is his contractor and that he shall grant the unfortunate student anything his heart desires. Instead of asking Endo to manipulate someone into falling in love with him, Rikiya only wishes to be sent back home so that the demon and his assistant can return to their own world. However, Endo is escaping an arranged marriage—and Rikiya might have to deal with the arrogant demon for a little longer than expected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
