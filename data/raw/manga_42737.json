    "synopsis": "Who were the legendary \"Generation of Miracles\" that led Teikou Middle School to three consecutive basketball championship titles? The group consisted of five prodigies—alongside their \"Phantom Sixth Member\"—and dominated the courts, striking down any who stood in their way. Outside of the sport, these talented players were simply middle school boys dealing with their own problems, such as getting through the midterm season and surviving an unlucky day.\n\nKuroko no Basuke: Replace captures the off-court adventures of Tetsuya Kuroko and the Generation of Miracles during their days at Teikou.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
