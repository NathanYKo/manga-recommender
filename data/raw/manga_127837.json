As thanks, he lets Kousuke reincarnate into another world. He was overjoyed to live the life of those overpowered protagonists seen in his favorite isekai stories.

This is the story of a protagonist living a peaceful life in the modern era with the cheat ability given to him by a god... not.\n\n(Source: Shousetsuka ni Narou, translated)",
