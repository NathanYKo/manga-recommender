    "synopsis": "As Maurina, she's on the run as the last of her kingdom's royal line. Disguised as Marie, she is just a maid, serving the victorious empire. She's never been very good at anything, so when she's told to make a wish, she asks for the ability to help others and bring them happiness. Now as visions of brilliant and skilled people fill her dreams, she's imbued with a bounty of abilities perfectly suited for any dilemma. But will her secrets last as the crown prince seeks out both Maurina and Marie?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
