First suffering the crippling loss of his closest friend after their junior high graduation in what was an ego destroying personal rejection of their friendship, he then went on to lose his young wife due to complications of childbirth.

Things seem to be going swimmingly well until his childhood friend makes a sudden reappearance, throwing Izumi into emotional turmoil. Just what is Takatsudo playing at, wanting to hang out like close friends again after all this time?
