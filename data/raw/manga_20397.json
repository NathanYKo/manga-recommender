    "synopsis": "Tomas Berard grew up without parents. Ten years after leaving his orphanage, he is occupied by his work as an assassin for hire. Commissions do not always come to him in a straightforward manner, and one day a black cat wearing a locket visits his window. Inside the locket is the name of his newest target—Miss Myra of the Lala household.\n\nIt is hardly difficult for Tomas to get inside the Lala castle and into the conservatory where Myra stands unguarded. With a single shot to her head, he assumes that his job is done. However, in the next instant, Myra rises up before his very eyes!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
