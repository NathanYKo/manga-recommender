    "synopsis": "I've been reborn as Clea Rino, the world's most wicked villainess! Before her death, Clea made a deal with the Demon King to marry her true love, Isaac Detroi. To get my life back, I must fulfill that contract for just six months. Guess I didn't read the fine print, because her body is weak. I lose 1 HP with every step! With time ticking, I'm signing over her family's fortune for Isaac's hand in marriage. It's purely business, so why am I catching feelings? Who knew this villainess had a heart?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
