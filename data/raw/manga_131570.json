    "synopsis": "Despite her poor experience with it, Mei Haruno possesses the ability to see special arrows above people that point at whoever they are in love with. Because of her unfortunate past, Mei cannot help but feel bitter whenever she comes across couples with arrows pointed at each other. On top of that, she is unable to see her own arrow, which causes her to consider the ability useless. Fed up, she attempts to make a fresh start at a new high school.\n\nHowever, Mei's life takes an unexpected turn when she meets a girl named Sayo Shirayuki, who was her best friend until moving away seven years prior. Before she left, Sayo confessed her love to Mei and told her that distance would never change her heart. It turns out that Sayo stuck true to that statement, as she still has an arrow directed at Mei. \n\nAfter Mei inadvertently saves another girl from a panic attack, the situation becomes even more complicated, with the girl, Rinna Fukatsu, also developing feelings for Mei. Now met with two admirers when she had planned to avoid romance completely, Mei must figure out how to deal with their emotions and her own feelings along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
