    "synopsis": "Akimoto has just started his high school career at Miya High and is burning with enthusiasm. Not because he's in the springtime of his youth, or because he has his eyes set on some beautiful upperclassmen; rather, Akimoto is overjoyed to finally be able to meet his long time Judo idol Saitou! Akimoto has watched Saitou ever since his middle school days, but the real Saitou isn't matching up to the Saitou of Akimoto's dreams. Foul mouthed, with a bad attitude and superiority complex, Saitou has decided to use Akimoto's admiration against him and turn him into his slave.\n\nBut Saitou has a deep, dark secret that he is hiding from his kouhai. Will Akimoto still look up to Saitou when it is revealed? Join Akimoto, Saitou and the rest of the Miya Judo team in this charming tale of high school love between senpai and kouhai.\n\n(Source: Juné)",
