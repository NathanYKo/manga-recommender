    "synopsis": "Living in a world infested with monsters is hard enough, but doing it without powers? That's Hanyeol's life in a nutshell. Fearsome beasts roam the earth and kill everyone in their path. Elite members of society called the Awakened mobilize to protect humanity with their supernatural abilities. Amidst it all, Hanyeol is just a poor porter, tasked as sideline support. But when a benevolent being gifts him with special abilities, he's ready to harvest all the loot and take it to the next level!\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
