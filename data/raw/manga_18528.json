    "synopsis": "As a dog lover, high school student Yuuko Ihara frequently stops by Wanda Pet Shop to brighten her day. On her way to school, she bumps into Toki Ookami, who is rumored to be the most intimidating boy at her school. Although Yuuko is initially daunted by him, Ookami does the unexpected: he confesses to her on the spot!\n\nTaken aback by his unusual confession, Yuuko finds it difficult to reject Ookami right away. As she interacts with him more, Yuuko discovers Ookami's deep affection for dogs and realizes that maybe he is not as fearsome as he seems.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
