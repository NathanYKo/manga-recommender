    "synopsis": "Yuu Koito has always enjoyed romance manga and love songs. She clings to them with the hope that she will one day experience a love story of her own—one that will sweep her off her feet and make her heart flutter. However, reality is often disappointing. When a classmate from junior high confesses his feelings to her, Yuu finds that she feels nothing. Unable to give him an answer, she becomes convinced that she is unable to fall in love.\n\nOne day, on her way to the student council room, Yuu encounters the council's president, Touko Nanami, turning down a confession from a boy. Inspired by Touko's confidence, Yuu turns to her for help. But when Touko becomes the next person to confess to Yuu, she is confused, yet her heart is set aflutter.\n\nYagate Kimi ni Naru is a manga about grappling with love and growing up. Will Yuu's long-awaited romance finally begin?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
