    "synopsis": "\"Alabaster\" is a criminal science fiction of suspense depicting the dark side of the human psyche that envies beautiful things.\n\nJames Block is a young black man with sinister intentions. When he is in prison, a strange old man tells him about the \"F\" laser beam that makes humans and any other living things invisible. After he has been released from prison, James receives the F laser beam. But because the beam is imperfect, he becomes semitransparent with an ugly figure. From that time on, he calls himself \"Alabaster\" and hates anything beautiful.\n\nUsing the F laser beam, he begins to eliminate hypocrites and those who boast of their beauty. When living things are exposed to the F laser beam long enough to become transparent, they die. Meanwhile, Dr. F, who told Alabaster the secret of the F laser beam, had previously used his daughter as a guinea pig to investigate its effects. The daughter, who was pregnant at the time, gave birth to a girl. The girl, who was named Ami, is completely invisible. Alabaster approaches Ami and begins to use her for his dark purposes. \n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",
