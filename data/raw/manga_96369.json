    "synopsis": "After performing another one of their countless pranks to none other than Reimu Hakurei herself, the Three Fairies of Light—Sunny Milk, Luna Child, and Star Sapphire—hear a rumor about a new fairy who is causing trouble. Asking around for more information, they eventually meet Clownpiece, the supposed fairy who has come from Hell.\n\nEnticed with Clownpiece's appearance, the trio tries to convince her to join them in their usual mischief. With a prankish nature and powers that make her stronger than many youkai, Clownpiece soon obliges. However, considering the current state of Hell—especially with its goddess Hecatia Lapislazuli—what could the presence of a fairy of Hell in Gensokyo mean for both worlds?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
