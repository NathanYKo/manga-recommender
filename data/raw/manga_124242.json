    "synopsis": "It is the start of yet another day in the Takashiro household, and Kouta Takashiro is gently but firmly roused from sleep by his personal maid, Meika Kujou. It has been a year since Meika started working for Kouta in exchange for an old favor extended to her by his father. This is all well and good, but it also means that Kouta lives alone with a girl who is a classmate at school and a maid at home!\n\nMeika rarely loses her professional touch when it comes to assisting Kouta, but lately, she has been slipping up all too often. Sadly, Kouta is far too dense to be aware of Meika's feelings—which are proving to be increasingly difficult to contain. Every time Meika's heart begins to race in anticipation, Kouta manages to disappoint her by failing to take a hint. However, hopeful as she is, Meika herself refuses to acknowledge her feelings toward Kouta.\n\nNonetheless, one's true emotions can only be restrained for so long—and Meika and Kouta's time spent denying their feelings is slowly but surely running out.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
