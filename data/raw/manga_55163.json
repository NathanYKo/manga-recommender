    "synopsis": "It is no coincidence that Megurigaoka Private High School is a second home for Yuki Takeya and the rest of the School Living Club. The club has only one mission: to spend day and night on campus promoting independence and engaging in a wide variety of school activities. Between Yuuri Wakasa's composure, Kurumi Ebisuzawa's dependability, Yuki Takeya's initiative, and their teacher Megumi Sakura's support, the club should have everything under control—in theory, that is.\n\nAs it turns out, living at school has its fair share of challenges. In order to make it to graduation and beyond, the members of the School Living Club must overcome their day-to-day troubles while making the most of their school lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
