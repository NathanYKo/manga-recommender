    "synopsis": "Saiga is a reserved leader and the strongest in a group of rough men. He has to deal with a new member that doesn't seem to harmonize with the group; this is Shikon, a shameless, conspicuous, witty youngster that, despite his looks, holds equal ability to the leader and, to Saiga's discomfort, seems to have taken an unusual interest in him. This is a historical drama that presents the fortune and mishaps of two mercenary samurai who work as contracted assassins--the life of people with no place to go...\n\n[Written by Queen2408]",
