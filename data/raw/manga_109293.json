    "synopsis": "Chihiro Hiyoshi is known for never turning down a request. Always accepting tasks given to her by friends and teachers alike, she is considered to be the ideal student by many. While seen as perfect in the student eye, Chihiro refutes the idea in her mind—aware that she gained her reputation due to her lack of courage in refusing her peers.\n\nOne day, Chihiro is asked to collect some papers for her teacher. Entering an archive, she stumbles and lands on top of a sleeping boy. Introducing himself as Risa Kisaragi, she learns that he is a mess of a student with terrible attendance rates and widely regarded as an utter slacker—the exact opposite of herself. Looking up to his personality, she begins to interact with Kisaragi to learn more about him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
