    "synopsis": "Our hero, Mo Fan, inherits a magical necklace—the next day, he wakes up to find that the world has changed. His high school now teaches magic, and students are encouraged to try and become accomplished magicians. A world that ran on science now runs on magic. However, some things are still the same. He still has a teacher who sees him as a hopeless student, classmates who look the same, a father who struggles to make ends meet, and a not-by-blood little sister who can't walk on her own. However, Mo Fan discovers that the vast majority of magicians can only harness one element of magic. As luck would have it, however, he is an exception—a versatile mage!\n\n(Source: Webnovel)",
