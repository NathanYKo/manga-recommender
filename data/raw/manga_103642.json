    "synopsis": "Takeshi Takasaka always makes time to visit his \"girlfriend,\" even though she is nothing more than a fictional character within a virtual reality game. While immersed in his VR, Takeshi gets an unexpected visit from Reina Kagurazaka, his childhood friend.\n\nReina wants to visit a shrine with Takeshi, but he is adamant to stay home, so he refuses her. Unsatisfied, Reina challenges him to a video game contest. If she wins, they will go out to the shrine together. If Takeshi wins, he will have his way with Reina's body. Despite Takeshi's overwhelming victory, he never actually planned on taking advantage of Reina. However, things change when Reina takes an interest in his crotch...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
