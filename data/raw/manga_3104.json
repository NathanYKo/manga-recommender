    "synopsis": "Japanese supermodel and fashion icon Haruko \"Liliko\" Hirukoma leads a posh life, wearing and promoting the biggest brands in the country. She stands at the top of the modeling industry with the beauty she has attained through full-body plastic surgery.\n\nHowever, Liliko's body soon begins to break down due to the extensive surgery she has been through and the medication she has taken. Worse still, her fear of growing old and being rendered useless begins to drive her insane. Helter Skelter is the story of Liliko's struggles to remain in the limelight in a world where people are so easily replaced.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
