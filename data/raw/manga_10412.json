    "synopsis": "It's high school meets nature documentary in this new shojo comedy! Kanoko Naedoko, a third-year student in junior high, doesn't make friends and keeps to herself. Which is fine by her because then she can be the ideal \"objective observer.\" Steamy love triangles, school gossip and courtyard politics only mean more data for Lady Kanoko! But when she befriends some of her classmates, what will happen to Kanoko? Will she become more than just an observer?\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Tsuki wa Higashi ni Hi wa Nishi ni (The Moon to the East, the Sun to the West)",
