    "synopsis": "Spring is here, but not in the air as a strange spell of red snow has also appeared—setting the stage for the story of 16-year-old Himeno Awayuki. After her father's remarriage, Himeno's ordinary low-class life changes as she and her father move into her step-family's lavish mansion. Though she misses her late mother and feels unwelcome in her new home, Himeno refuses to give in to loneliness.\n\nUnexpectedly, Himeno's life is further shifted from the ordinary after meeting a little boy while heading to school. This encounter leads her to wake up in another world where she later finds him with six other boys, all wearing strange outfits! This group of seven, the Leafe Knights, protect the source of energy of all life, Leafe, from the Princess of Disaster. As the villain begins to steal Leafe through her red snow, the Knights find themselves unable to protect it by themselves.\n\nTheir only hope is the legendary Pretear, a princess who can help protect the Leafe and turn the snow white. Though Himeno doesn't believe them at first, she later accepts the Leafe Knights' request to become the Prétear after seeing the Princess of Disaster's evil seeds for herself—an action that begins this dramatic magical girl take on Snow White.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
