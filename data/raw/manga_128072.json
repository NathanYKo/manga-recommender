But now, years later, all eight people have been reincarnated, and some retain memories of their previous lives! Even reincarnation is not able to stop their love, be it between a princess and her butler, a master and his cat, a hot-headed man and his equally hot-headed arranged fiancée, or a devoted man and his sickly lover.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
