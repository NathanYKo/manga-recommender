Instead, she finds Tokinaga, a researcher with the Anti-God Scientific Research Institute. While Waka tries to decide if she should trust Tokinaga, he quickly realizes Waka is hiding a dangerous secret of her own—one that may just be the key to killing off the gods once and for all.\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",
