    "synopsis": "When her parents need to move to another city for work, Aoi Nishimori decides to stay behind and starts living in an apartment on her own. Unexpectedly, she discovers that her next-door neighbor is Shuusei Kugayama, the \"prince\" in her high school who turns down anyone who confesses to him—including her best friend, Moe Shibuya. Aoi angrily confronts Shuusei for rejecting Moe; things quickly get heated, with Shuusei calling Aoi an eyesore, leaving her disappointed in the so-called \"prince.\"\n\nTo make things worse, Aoi's clumsiness renders Shuusei’s apartment unlivable and the two have to live together in Aoi's apartment as a temporary solution. However, Aoi gets to know Shuusei better while living under the same roof and begins to realize that he is not the cold-hearted, despicable person she initially thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
