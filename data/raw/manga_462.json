    "synopsis": "Count D has opened his petshop again, this time in Tokyo's Shinjuku!\n\nFor those who haven't read Petshop of Horrors, Count D's Petshop is a place where one can find animals from the most ordinary housepets to savage predators to mystical beasts that should belong only in legends. Customers often find that their new pets change their lives more than they expect, fulfilling their dreams, or realizing their nightmares.\n\n(Source: MU)",
