    "synopsis": "Nice guy grocery manager Iori is stuck in a rut. He's overworked, underappreciated, and still grieving the disappearance of his beloved cat. But one fateful night, after rescuing a stray on his way home, Iori wakes up to a shock: the stray is gone, and in its place is a feisty, naked girl! Pushy, adorable, and oddly familiar, Mii-chan isn't just crashing at Iori's place—she's hiding a big secret. As Mii-chan paws at his heart, Iori's life is about to take a purr-fectly unpredictable turn!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
