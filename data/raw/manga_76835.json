    "synopsis": "Kanna Shimodaira enrolls in Toritsu Toyose High School and immediately joins their volleyball club. During club introductions, he announces his position as a pinch server. Taken aback by this unorthodox declaration, other members introduce themselves: wing spiker Jouji Mashira, setter Ibuki Matsukata, and libero Susumu Kaneda. It turns out, in middle school, all three of them were players chosen to represent the Tokyo prefecture. Alongside talented teammates, Kanna will need to work incredibly hard to achieve his goal of becoming a starter—unless he has a hidden skill.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
