    "synopsis": "Geumja Kim is the biggest (and only) fan of Kyle du Vilteon, a side character in the fantasy novel King Maker. Her never-ending search for Kyle content is forever changed when she dies while rereading the book... and somehow awakens in Kyle's bedroom to a new life within the novel's pages! She is then shocked to learn that Kyle can also hear her thoughts—luckily, only if she thinks of his name. Still, there's no time for this fangirl to daydream because Kyle is doomed to die. Can she save the apple of her eye... and in the process, become his?\n\n(Source: Tapas Media)",
