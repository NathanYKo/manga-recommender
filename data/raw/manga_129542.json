    "synopsis": "For a gacha game enthusiast like Hashimoto, work is essential to earn money for his unusual spending habits. However, his office job serving the cruel demon boss, Makoto Shirase, is a living hell. Whenever he has the time to rest, Hashimoto immerses himself in an online game and often complains to his friend \"UMA\" about his stringent manager.\n\nWhile the two become close virtually, they mutually decide to arrange an offline meeting. Hashimoto looks forward to finally seeing the person behind the screen, but UMA is someone he least expects...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
