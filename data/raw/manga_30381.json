    "synopsis": "Bored of consuming the same greedy, arrogant souls of bad cooks, the Earl of Poor Eating known as Dogma sets off to find the \"soul of a true chef\" and make it the grandest meal in all of Hell. His search brings him to Satoru Moriya, an average middle school student who does not put much effort into anything he does. Determined to turn Satoru's soul into the finest delicacy, Dogma temporarily possesses his body and forces him to become a gourmet that has never been seen before.\n\nAbsolutely against the idea of being consumed, Satoru tries his hardest to shake off Dogma's influence and attempts to find someone else for the Earl to consume. His plan ends up backfiring when Satoru enrolls at Shokusen, the elite high school dedicated to farming and cooking. After Dogma helps Satoru win in an impromptu cooking match with one of Shokusen's best students, the boy secures a mid-year transfer but is left to fend for himself.\n\nDespite his predicament, Satoru is more determined than ever to become a world-class chef. Even with Dogma refusing to help him at times, this newfound passion is sending Satoru down a gourmet journey that will shape his soul in more ways than one.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
