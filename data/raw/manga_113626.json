    "synopsis": "Visible scars cover the face and body of Leo Cornelia, indisputable proof that she has been through many grueling battles. Known as the \"Sacred Sword,\" she is a knight unrivaled by any other, the toughest throughout the land. As the only daughter born in a house of knights, she was raised by a strict father and has dedicated her life to learning the way of the sword. Her purpose was for the battlefield, not about living her life like a woman—until she meets a boy who confesses his affection for her.\n\nHarboring an unrequited love, Fooly Dent admires all of the qualities that Leo possesses despite her perceived lack of femininity. From time to time, he praises her on their quests together, causing Leo to act bashful and embarrassed. Unable to act like a lady beneath her tough exterior, will Leo ever let herself be vulnerable, learn to accept her feminine side, and reciprocate Fooly's feelings?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
