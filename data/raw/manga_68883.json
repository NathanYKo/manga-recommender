    "synopsis": "Colette is the only doctor in her village and has earned the trust of many. However, an overwhelming amount of work has left her exhausted and desperate for a break. Wanting to discover a place where her heart could be at peace, she jumps into a well.\n\nColette wakes up and finds herself in the Land of the Dead, ruled by the god Hades—who is in charge of judging the souls of the demised. But Hades has fallen ill, causing his servants to beg Colette to treat him. Unable to ignore their demands and Hades' condition, it is up to Colette and her skills to look after the man and help him return to his duties as the Lord of the Dead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
