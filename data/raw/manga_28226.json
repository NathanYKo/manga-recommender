    "synopsis": "Just having broken up with her boyfriend of five years, 26-year-old Michiyo Ozawa goes drinking with her coworkers. She meets with an unfortunate accident when the elevator to her apartment is out of order. Having little choice but to resort to asking the nearest household for access to their toilet, she meets Zenji Oyamada, a tenant who seems like a somewhat ordinary guy on the surface—until Ozawa notices the mountain of boxes in his room. Oyamada's brother likes sending him these boxes that contain trinkets from each of his eccentric, rapidly changing hobbies while overseas.\n\nInstantly intrigued by the boxes, Ozawa is asked by Oyamada if she would like to open one of them. As Ozawa does so, a heartwarming story about an ordinary couple and the strange boxes they open begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
