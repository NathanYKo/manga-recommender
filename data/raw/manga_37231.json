    "synopsis": "Tomo has always been stuck with the dependent Miyako ever since she was born. For half of his life, he had been forced to look out for her due to her clumsiness and unreliability. Simply put, he \"hates\" her. But there is something that completely prevents him from telling her his real feelings. When she is about to move to the United States, will he be able to love and let go, all before it's too late? \n\nA lovely, touching story about a boy and the one most important to him.\n\n(Source: MU)",
