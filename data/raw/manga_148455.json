    "synopsis": "The human race plunged into a war against dragons, who have invaded the earth! At the same time, among the humans arose people with supernatural powers, called psykers. Through the countless sacrifices of psykers, the war seemed to be coming to an end with the human race as the victors. But when a psyker with the ability to see the future foretold that the dragons will be returning in 15 years, the people established Ark, a facility to train children born with psychic abilities to prepare for the last war of the human race. There are only three years remaining until the prophesized war. What will happen next?!\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",
