    "synopsis": "The Lands Between is a domain where demigods once waged war against each other to claim the shards of the Elden Ring, a set of runes containing immense power. In the present, an exiled man named Aseo emerges from a graveyard in Limgrave with almost nothing to his name and no recollection of how he ended up there. Immediately encountering the cruel land and its inhabitants, Aseo has little hope for survival—until he crosses paths with Melina, a mysterious maiden who makes him a dangerous offer.\n\nWith little choice in the matter, Aseo accepts the request from Melina. However, in exchange for providing some much needed aid in his travels, he must take Melina with him, following a guiding light down an arduous road to the Erdtree. Armed with nothing but a loincloth, a club, and his trusty steed Torrent, Aseo must brave the many dangers and face off against the quirky inhabitants of the Lands Between.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
