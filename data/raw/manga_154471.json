    "synopsis": "When Reinhardt Lincke first lived her life, she felt nothing but misery and rage. Her fiancé, Crown Prince Michel Allanketh, called off their engagement and exiled her after her beloved father died in his stead. It was hardly a banishment; wealth and warmth surrounded her in a prosperous territory, but her heart darkened with each passing day, aching from the injustice and betrayal. It is the strength of her anguish that miraculously transports her 15 years into the past, just before Michel abandons her.\n\nReinhardt's sole purpose becomes retaliation against the arrogant prince who robbed her of everything. She stabs Michel's leg and receives a harsh punishment: life in the snowy and dangerous mountains at one of the empire's forgotten corners. When Reinhardt finds herself in trouble, a small and disheveled child saves her life. She quickly realizes that the child is the emperor's 16-year-old illegitimate son, a skilled assassin whom Michel was to soon discover and mold into a perfectly obedient and loyal servant. Michel's most formidable weapon now belongs to Reinhardt—and she will stop at nothing to exact her revenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
