    "synopsis": "Teru Kurebayashi is left all alone in the world after the death of her brother, Souichirou. Well, all alone except for \"Daisy,\" someone that she can always talk to and who never hesitates to cheer her up. However, Teru has never met Daisy, she has no idea what he looks like, and her only means of contacting him is through a cell phone that her brother left for her.\n\nIn stark contrast to the kind words and encouragement Teru receives from Daisy, she gets nothing but grief from the rude school janitor, Tasuku Kurosaki, who forced Teru to work for him after she accidentally broke a window. But while Kurosaki seems like a lazy good-for-nothing who only enjoys making her miserable, is there more to him than meets the eye?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 16: Hetakuso Cupid (The Hopeless Cupid)",
