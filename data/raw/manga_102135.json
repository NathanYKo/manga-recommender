    "synopsis": "Miwa Takanose, a high school student and shoujo manga aficionado, prefers the fictional world of heroes and miracles to her dull reality. The chivalrous protagonist of Kirameki Heart, her favorite series, is the only boy she cares about, and she has no plans to change. But when a careless step and a head full of clouds lead her right into the arms of Kiriatsu Nakajou, Miwa's world begins to shift.\n\nKiriatsu bears an uncanny resemblance to Miwa's fictional hero, and his solemn personality makes her heart flutter. She keeps running into him so frequently that Kiriatsu quickly becomes a highlight in her otherwise uninteresting life. However, Miwa's childhood bully soon arrives back in town, bringing with him unpleasant memories of pain and humiliation. But this time, with Kiriatsu by her side, she hopes that things will go differently.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
