    "synopsis": "Tomo Aizawa and Junichirou \"Jun\" Kubota are the tightest bros you would ever see. They roughhouse and spar, but through thick and thin, they have got each other's back. Yet, there is just one small problem: Tomo is in love with Jun!\n\nSince she was young, tomboyish Tomo has been just another one of the guys; due to his extreme muscle-brained nature, Jun does not notice any of her advances—not even when she explicitly confesses. To add insult to injury, for the longest time, he did not even realize that she was a girl. Will Tomo ever be able to catch Jun's eye and escape the infamous bro zone?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
