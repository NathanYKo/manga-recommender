    "synopsis": "Helmut was a child who had been abandoned in the Demonic Beast Forest at birth. Raised by Demonic Beasts, the first human that he met was the Sword Saint Darien. Little did Helmut know that the chance encounter would soon shake the foundation of his fate...\n\n\"Grow stronger If you want to get out of here.\"\n\nThe boy who'd lived like a beast was thrown into the human world! He possessed overwhelming swordsmanship, outstanding looks and sharp intelligence, but there was one thing he lacked: humanity. I am no longer a prey. I am now a predator!\n\n(Source: Yeonpil, translated)",
