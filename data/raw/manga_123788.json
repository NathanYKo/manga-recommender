    "synopsis": "It is a predictable story: Lee Haesoo is an apathetic freelance writer, Choi Joowon is an arrogant actor, and despite their unhealthy relationship, they cannot stay away from each other. With every silent goodbye, they both know that, eventually, they will seek one another again. That is when for Haesoo, the popular photographer Song Taekyung enters the picture. Taekyung, a mysterious artist, rejects all interviews—but requests his newest one to be conducted by none other than Haesoo himself.\n\nAs the intricate web of Haesoo and Joowon's long history untangles, Haesoo's complicated feelings only spread onto his newfound connection with Taekyung. Believing he could never truly love anyone, Haesoo must face the challenging life that pushes him to choose the path that will finally make him happy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
