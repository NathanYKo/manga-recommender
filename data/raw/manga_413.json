    "synopsis": "Negishi, a self-proclaimed normal high school girl, is suddenly confessed to by a boy whom she has never met before. Introducing himself as a long time admirer that had finally found the resolve to confess his feelings, Hoshino declares that everything will work out between the two as long as he remains unabashedly honest with her. After denying Hoshino's sudden request for a date, Negishi, bewildered but intrigued with Hoshino's candidness, agrees to walk home with him.\n\nThus begins the romantic comedy Love Roma, which follows the progressing relationship between Hoshino, who says whatever is on his mind with absolutely no reserve, and Negishi, playing the straight man to the boy's comic persistence of his feelings toward her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
