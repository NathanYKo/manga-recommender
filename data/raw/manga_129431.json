    "synopsis": "In 2021, Harry Makito, a genius magician, was holding a one time only retirement show in Tokyo when he burned to death in an unexpected accident. He was 17 years old, or so one would think. But he lived, finding himself reincarnated 400 years earlier in Medieval Europe during the age of the witch trials! Now he fights against the church which unjustly brands women as witches with his tricks disguised as miracles. It's like real magic!\n\n(Source: Kodansha, translated)",
