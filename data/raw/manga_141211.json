    "synopsis": "When Akira Minato inherits an old, run-down laundromat from his grandfather, he sees it as an opportunity to recover from his grueling corporate job and spend his days in laid-back leisure. But all that changes when a new customer comes knocking—one who's maybe a bit too good-looking. Despite their growing closer, Akira is determined not to let high school hottie Shintarou Katsuki find out he's gay...until a casual slip of the tongue gives away his secret.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",
