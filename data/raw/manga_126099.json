    "synopsis": "At first glance, Kirari Aokigahara appears to be an average, happy-go-lucky first-year high school student. But instead of running late for school one day, she finds herself running late for a meeting at Seaside Cafe hosted by Rushio, the admin of a website called Suicide Cafe.\n\nThe sparkling, charming young lady stands out amongst the gathering's cast of suicidal individuals. She joins the group in swallowing sleeping pills and entering a car filled to the brim with toxic charcoal smoke. However, rather than dying, she wakes up from a dream about a girl's suicide and is surprised to see that the once-suicidal group appears to be revitalized. Upset that she did not die, Kirari goes home and attempts to kill herself, only to realize that she cannot die, no matter the method.\n\nRushio then appears to tell Kirari that she has been chosen to save people from ending their lives, including the girl in her dream earlier, and become a magical girl of salvation—a \"Suicide Girl.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
