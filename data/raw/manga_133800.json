    "synopsis": "With her cute looks and successful career, fashion model Airi Hirakawa is content with her life—until she wakes up dazed and bruised, chained up in a room filled to the brim with trash. Her captor is Hirokazu Imai, a crazed stalker and fan who has been watching her for ages. He has her underwear, used sanitary pads, and now her as well. Before Airi is even given a chance to breathe, she is forced to marry Hirokazu. From then on, her days are filled with rape, brutality, and torture; but she never loses hope to regain her freedom—even if she is tainted in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
