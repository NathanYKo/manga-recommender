    "synopsis": "Kuchisake-onna, also known as the \"Slit-Mouth Woman,\" is a self-proclaimed living urban legend, having been created from human fear and superstition. Unfortunately for her, she is losing notoriety as people have begun calling her legitimacy into question. To add to her worries, not only is 13-year-old Kouichi Sano unfazed by her oral deformity, he also doesn't hesitate to tease her! Amicably referring to her as \"Miroku-chan,\" the boy leaves the masked myth wondering—is she failing as a monster, or does Kouichi view her as a genuine companion?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Kuchi ga Saketemo Kimi ni wa, alternatively titled Even If You Avoid the Slit, is the second manga by Akari Kajimoto to be inspired by Kuchisake-onna. Published in Young Gangan magazine in Fall 2018, it is not to be confused with Akari's third manga of the same name—an alternate version of the story featuring the same characters—serialized in Shounen Jump+ in 2020.",
