Little does he know, Yeowoon is just a regular guy trying to land a job and enjoy his free time—until he finds himself dealing with a hostile neighbor. As their real-life misunderstandings escalate, the two unknowingly team up in their favorite online game, forming an unexpected duo. \n\n(Source: Lezhin Entertainment)",
