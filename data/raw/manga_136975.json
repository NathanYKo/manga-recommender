    "synopsis": "Dreams about finding her one true love are all Yuuki Honda has. She has thrown herself into college work but still yearns for a fateful encounter with a man who is just as handsome and charming as her beloved manga characters. Despite her desire to meet new people, she finds herself out of her element in a crowded club. Here she meets Iori Souma, who is drunk, disdainful, and looks down on Yuuki, bluntly saying things too embarrassing to hear.\n\nAlthough he comes off as impolite and rough, Iori quickly proves that first impressions can be deceiving. When he calls Yuuki to apologize, she confesses her romantic aspirations. Instead of the expected scorn, Iori offers to help Yuuki find her future soulmate. While Iori's cool but selfless nature makes him a great friend, Yuuki can no longer ignore just how fast her heart beats when she is by his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
