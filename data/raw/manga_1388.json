    "synopsis": "Left in Pony's Home orphanage as a baby, Candace \"Candy\" White grew up to be a boisterous and energetic girl. But when her best friend of six years, Annie, is finally adopted by a wealthy family, Candy is upset to lose her. Crying on the hill near her orphanage, the young girl meets a princely boy clothed in Scottish attire, who plays his bagpipe to comfort her. This encounter causes her to dub him the \"Prince of the Hill,\" as he did not reveal his name to her.\n\nSix years later at the age of 12, Candy is taken in to be a companion for Eliza and Neil Leagen—siblings who treat her terribly. At her new home, she meets Anthony Brown, a boy who seemingly resembles that prince-like character she once met! Possibly reunited, Candy now finds herself at the start of a journey she will never forget.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
