    "synopsis": "In the densely populated district of Ikebukuro, \"normalcy\" is nearly impossible for its residents. This is to be expected with the notorious Headless Rider haunting its winding streets. However, six months after the disbandment of the Dollars, no one has seen the infamous figure. Despite this, the city has hardly settled down, and three new figures emerge to take center stage.\n\nGrowing up in the boonies of Akita, Yahiro Mizuchi has always believed himself to be a \"monster,\" a fact only affirmed by those around him. However, spurred on by the words of a stranger, he sets out to Ikebukuro to witness the monstrous Headless Rider. Meanwhile, Kuon Kotonami is involved with nearly all the dealings going on in Ikebukuro, all with one goal—to make money. For him, the Headless Rider is one of the most lucrative markets out there. Conversely, Himeka Tatsugami wishes to avoid the notorious Rider at all costs; after all, that monster has taken far too much from her.\n\nAs new and old faces collide, the Headless Rider is at the center of it all, and—despite its absence—it continues to influence Ikebukuro, the district that never sleeps.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
