    "synopsis": "Biology teacher Saki Terano and physical education teacher Asuka Hayama work at the same school. Although they appear professional in front of their students, the two women are actually dating in secret. With Asuka's tomboyish personality and Saki's childlike nature, the two have much to explore about one another as they face the wonders of their thriving romance. Between curious coworkers and friends, memories of young love, and tender moments with each other, the couple learns to grow and mature in new and exciting ways together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
