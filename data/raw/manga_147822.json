    "synopsis": "Before the hit novel The Prince Among the Roses swayed the people's hearts in the dethroned Prince Rayburn Espelindo's favor, Angela was his first true fan. Only a commoner with no more than public sketches of Rayburn as her inspiration, Angela wrote a fanfiction piece, ignoring all the heinous rumors about the prince's cruelty and bloodthirst. But somehow, her work made it to the big cities and was published without her knowing.\n\nRayburn and his twin sister, Hoya, are solely known as the shameful children whom the emperor discarded and expelled from the imperial palace. As Rayburn's rising fame threatens the crown's authority, they declare the bold novelist an enemy of the empire who will face execution. However, Hoya plans to use Angela's novel to reform Rayburn's reputation by having her write a sequel.\n\nNow exiled from her country home and thrown into dangerous political schemes, Angela must pretend to be a scholar sponsored by the Espelindos. But for Angela, writing in secret is a dream come true—because she gets to freely fangirl over her beloved Rayburn to her heart's content!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
