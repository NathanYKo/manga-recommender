    "synopsis": "In a world where many different species coexist, Takahashi inherits his father's youkai-exclusive apartment complex after he passes away. One day, Takahashi meets and instantly becomes attracted to a yuki-onna, or snow woman, named Yukino. Although they initially get along, an argument drives the two apart.\n\nWhile pondering how to fix their situation, Takahashi finds a strange ring inside a mysterious box. The included description states that if one directs their desires at a youkai who is within view of the ring, it is possible to control their mind. Takahashi remains skeptical until, during another desperate attempt to talk to Yukino, he shows the ring to her and witnesses its potential. With immense power at his fingertips, Takahashi must decide whether to use the ring to restore his relationship with Yukino or to fulfill his primitive desires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
