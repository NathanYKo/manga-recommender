    "synopsis": "Land of the Blindfolded is the story of high school student Outsuka Kanade who can sometimes see a person's future with a touch, and transfer student Naitou Arou, whose ESP is limited to past events. When Kanade glimpses an unfortunate incident coming, can she change it? She soon befriends Arou, who's no novice—he can turn his ability on or off at will, even using it to see an object's \"memories.\" Are these teenaged seers of the past and future made for each other? And who's right: Arou with his \"hands off\" policy about meddling in people's lives, or Kanade whose more proactive stance has already had unhappy consequences?\n\n(Source: CMX)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Machigaeru Otoko (The Boy Who Makes Mistakes), Matsuri no Ato (After the Sports Festival)\nVolume 2: Hyakka Jimusho no Akuma (The Devil in the Flowered Office)\nVolume 3: Ame no Naka (Inside Rain)",
