    "synopsis": "Branded as an incompetent ruler, the life of Princess Mia Luna Tearmoon ends at the guillotine. But to her surprise, Mia reawakens in her own body eight years before her execution. Freed from the torment of being imprisoned, Mia assumes it had all been a bad nightmare until she finds her old diary detailing the future ahead.\n\nDetermined to change her fate, Mia tries to correct the mistakes she made in her previous life. Not only does she earn the trust of her allies that she had previously reprimanded, but she also reluctantly makes sacrifices to help the people around her. Despite being the same selfish and self-centered girl she has always been, Mia strives to save her kingdom from its approaching demise and thus herself from facing the guillotine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
