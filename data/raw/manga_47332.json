    "synopsis": "Seven months ago, the hellish \"King's Game\" took place. One of the participants, Nobuaki Kanazawa, transfers to another school after surviving the lethal ordeal. But the trauma he experienced, including the loss of his friends, has left him afraid to be close to anyone ever again. Soon, what Nobuaki fears the most arrives in the form of a simple text message: orders from the King concerning a new King's Game. Nobuaki understands the brutal rules all too well. You cannot quit halfway. The entire class must participate. All commands must be followed within 24 hours.\n\nNobuaki begs his classmates to take the game seriously, lest they share their predecessors' tragic fate. Most, however, laugh it off just as Nobuaki and his classmates did all those months ago. Even the most skeptical among them cannot help but believe him when their classmates start dying one after another for disobeying orders. And if the game wasn’t bad enough, there is one more surprise in store for Nobuaki: one of his classmates is also a survivor of a previous King's Game. And they will do anything to win.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
