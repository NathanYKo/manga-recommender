    "synopsis": "A wounded soldier with a disturbed mind kidnaps the priest who tries to help him. He then has the brilliant idea of going AWOL with the priest. He's in the middle of the African desert in WWII, with supplies running low and his sanity (or is it his morality?) long gone. All that's left is sex and agony. And maybe, eventually, death.\n\n(Source: MU)",
