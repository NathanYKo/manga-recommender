    "synopsis": "Being acutely ill, a young girl has spent most of her life in a hospital room playing otome games to fill her time. However, she one day finds herself in the midst of a scene from one of these games as the story's villainess, Aileen Lauren Dautriche.\n\nAt the banquet to celebrate the end of the academy's winter term, the crown prince and Aileen's childhood friend, Cedric Jeanne Elmir, publicly annuls his engagement with Aileen and announces that he is in love with Lilia Rainworth, the game's female protagonist. Aware of the tragic future ahead of her and determined to change it, the young girl resolves to conquer the game's final boss, the \"Demon King\" and Cedric's half-brother, Claude Jeanne Elmir, by making him fall in love with her instead.\n\nWith time running out, can Irene succeed with her plans, or will she remain bound to the ill-fated ending that awaits her?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
