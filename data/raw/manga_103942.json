    "synopsis": "In his final year of high school, Taichi Ichinose finds himself sharing a class with his popular childhood friend Touma Mita for the third year in a row. Meanwhile, Taichi is hesitant to interact with his shy and clumsy classmate, Futaba Kuze, despite seeing her as a reflection of himself.\n\nHowever, after an encounter in the library brings them together, Taichi discovers that Futaba has feelings for Touma. Initially harboring doubts at the prospect, he decides to help her after she declares an emotional yet firm decision to change. As spring comes into full bloom, the three classmates find themselves in a relationship entangled by intricate emotions and personal conflicts while they navigate through an uncertain future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
