    "synopsis": "Photography student Kim Yeseul has always lived her life as others told her to. \"Study, so that you can get into a good college,\" is the command often echoed by her mother. And so, not minding her looks or impression on others, Yeseul dedicates all her time to studying. However, despite her best efforts, her grades are middling, she has no friends, and her appearance is average at best.\n\nOn a whim, Yeseul goes to a makeup parlor, hoping to resemble Joo Heewon, the most gorgeous girl at her school, even a little bit. Her hopes are dashed, however, when the result is unfitting and clownlike. At the same time, Cheon Yuseong, a genius makeup artist, is searching for the perfect canvas. After a chance encounter, an unlikely partnership is formed between the two—a plain girl and a young genius—as they team up to compete in the televised competition known as \"Face Off Cinderella.\" \n\nThe odds are not in their favor; ruthless competitors, Heewon herself, and greedy corporate executives all stand in the pair's way. If Yeseul and Yuseong are to win, they will have to truly stand out from the crowd and show that makeup isn't for the sake of others—it is meant to be for yourself and yourself alone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
