Takebe thus resolved herself to quit delinquency, but the result of that was a fated meeting with her old rival, Soramori. Losing a fist-fight against Soramori, for some reason or other Takebe was now dating her. What kind of relationship did the two of them have back in high school? And would Takebe ever manage to graduate from delinquency...!?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
