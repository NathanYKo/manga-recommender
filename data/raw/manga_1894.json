    "synopsis": "There's something mysterious happening at the old school building. People say it's haunted, but Fuuko knows better, and she has the pictures to prove it! It's Fuuko's first year at high school, and a classmate has caught her eye. Maybe it's because he's cute and mysterious -- or maybe it's because she's seen him walk up walls! Fuuko will do what it takes to get close to Ruka, but at what cost to herself?\n\n(Source: Ephemeral-Dreams)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 3: H²Love",
