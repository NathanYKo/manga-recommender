But when they start living together, Maki, who was innocent and pure until now, starts depending on Rintarou to appease his carnal urges. With the freshly minted pervert finding the very sight of Rintarou a turn on, Rintarou must decide whether he should draw a line or explore his feelings for his friend. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
