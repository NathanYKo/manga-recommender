    "synopsis": "After their classes are dismissed, Okuto Nakamura and Aiki Hirose decide to travel back home together. While walking on a quiet street, Hirose insists that they kiss, with Nakamura succumbing to his request and returning the ardent passion. As it turns out, this is all but a dream—and Nakamura wakes up being sucked on by his pet octopus instead!\n\nSince the start of the school year, 16-year-old Nakamura has harbored feelings for Hirose. His timidness results in him having few friends and unlikely to profess his love. However, he has made progress, and the pair are now proper friends. With an eventful summer season looming ahead, Nakamura's pursuit for love continues!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
