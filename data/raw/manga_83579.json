    "synopsis": "When classmates Mayuri Asana and Youji Aikawa catch their lovers kissing each other, they form a secret pact: to get back at them, Mayuri suggests that she and Aikawa have a love affair of their own. But these sorts of clandestine dealings are never simple, and what started out as a business-like conspiracy soon sparks something between them. Initially a romance born from revenge, they must now deal with the troubles and secrecy that come with being partners in crime and love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: this entry is for the two-volume release and not the webcomic serialized on the E★Everystar platform.",
