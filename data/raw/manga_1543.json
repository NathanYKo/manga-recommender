Blaming God for her misfortune, Minene vows to destroy anyone and anything related to the deity. The delinquent decides to disguise herself as a recently deceased detective in order to get closer to her targets. However, Minene is soon found out and flees.\n\nJust when she is at her wits' end, a godlike creature grants her the ability to foresee the future on her cellphone—a Future Diary. Will Minene be able to achieve her ambitious goals with this newfound power?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
