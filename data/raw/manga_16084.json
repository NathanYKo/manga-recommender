    "synopsis": "Mitsuya Kishimoto's bespectacled colleague Shiomi \"Shio\" Aoyama—popular through his website as Shiomi—frequently participates in IRL catch-ups among bloggers. In one such meeting, Shio gets the opportunity to meet the current idol of the internet world, Miya, who is supposedly a high school girl behind a humorous picture blog. However, much to his surprise, Miya turns out to be neither a teenager nor a girl, but Mutsumi Yamaoka, an adult man of a rather large build who makes kindness abound in any situation with his warm and fuzzy aura. What begins as a simple friendship soon begins to confuse Shio, as the two of them spend more time together—and sometimes wake up in the same bed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
