    "synopsis": "Shun Aoi has always been in the shadow of her older sister Mio, an extraordinarily talented girl loved by everyone around her. Because of this, Shun has gradually developed a nonchalant attitude and complete apathy toward her future. The only place she finds comfort is a forest near her school, where she is able to play the flute all by herself.\n\nOne day, her peace is disrupted by the sudden appearance of Yousuke Tokisaka, a charming and cheerful boy who turns out to be the prodigious son of a renowned photographer. Despite Yousuke's eccentric nature, Shun finds herself drawn to the young boy, who proclaims that he loves Shun's flute playing. This unexpected encounter soon paves the way for a genuine and romantic relationship—and with Yousuke's help, Shun may finally discover her own value.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
