    "synopsis": "Unaware of her feelings for him, Shouta Azuma is persuaded by his childhood friend, Miwa Okamato, to enter the same high school as her, where they can pursue badminton at a higher level and continue to spend time together. Much to her disappointment, the carefree and easygoing Shouta rejects the idea, insisting that he only plays badminton for fun.\n\nOne day, after a fateful encounter with Yuhi Kitou, a talented badminton player who lost the ability to speak, Shouta becomes captivated by her graceful presence on the court. However, as Yuhi disappears before he gets to know her name, he continues to search for her and cannot get her off his mind. His search for Yuhi leads him to Anan Hashiba, whose strength in badminton helps him to understand the thrill of playing against formidable opponents.\n\nAs Shouta discovers his passion for excelling in what he loves and realizes that becoming stronger will eventually lead him to Yuhi, he steps into the world of competitive badminton.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
